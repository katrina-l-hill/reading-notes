## DRF Permissions

- Permissions, combined with authentication and throttling, determines whether a request should be granted or denied access.  
- Permissions are checked at the start of the view and will typically use the authentication information in the **request.user** and **request.auth** properties to determine if the incoming request should be permitted.  
- Permissions are used to grant or deny access for different classes of users to different parts of the API.  
- In REST framework, permissions are always defined as a list of permission classes.  
- If permissions checks fail, one of the following exceptions is raised **exceptions.PermissionDenied** or **exceptions.NotAuthenticated**.
