Lists:
-	Ordered lists are arranged in a specific manner and in an order for how they should be done or read. For example, instructions in a vehicle maintenance manual for how to change a tire would be a type of ordered list.
-	Ordered lists are numbered or lettered sequentially.
-	Ordered lists should be read top to bottom.
-	Unordered lists are not arranged in a specific manner and don’t have to performed or read in a particular order. For example, items on your desk can be listed but not in any specific order. 
-	Unordered lists are not numbered. They usually start with a bullet point or dash.
-	Unordered lists can be read in any order (i.e., top-to-bottom, bottom-to-top).
-	Definition lists are made up of vocabulary words and their definitions.
-	Nested lists are placed inside other lists (i.e., ordered lists, unordered lists, definition lists).
Boxes:
-	Boxes are used to contain text so that you can change how the content is displayed on a webpage.
-	For example, you can adjust the width and height of a box around text so that the text is displayed narrow or wide.
-	You can also change the border, margin, and padding of a box so that there is a thin/thick border, narrow/wide margin, or large/small space around the text inside the box.

Arrays:
-	Arrays are variables that can contain more than one value.
-	The values are a list of items. For example, names, shapes, colors, etc.
-	Arrays can be used to store related items lumped together.
-	They are created similarly to other variables, but variables can contain different data types (e.g., string, number, and Boolean).
-	There are two types of arrays: literal and constructor.
-	Array literal lets you put the data type values within brackets, while array constructors allow you to put data type values in parentheses. In each type, the values are comma separated.
-	In order to access the data type values in an array, you need to ensure they are in numbered lists (i.e., ordered lists using numbers). 

Switch Statements:
-	A switch statement allows an action to be performed if the value of the switch matches a specific condition in a code block.
-	An expression is assigned to the switch variable, so once the switch statement is run, each case in the code block will be evaluated to see if it matches the value of the expression.
Type Coercion & Weak Typing:
-	Type coercion is when JavaScript converts data types it’s not certain of the meaning into something it thinks will complete the operation it’s running.
-	For example, if you put a string value in, type coercion may change it to a number.
-	Weak typing is when the variable used in JavaScript can be changed easily for data types.
-	Whereas strong typing is when the data type has to be strictly specified to a variable.
Loops:
-	Loops go through an expression to check if a condition is true, for which it will then run a specific code block.
-	If there condition is false, the loop will run until the condition is true.
-	A break in a loop will cause loop to stop and move to a different code block to run.
