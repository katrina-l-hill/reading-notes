# Read – Open-Source Software Contribution

- GitHub is the largest open-source community (OSS) in the world.  
- Open-source software is free to use and allows you to be part of a bigger project.  
- By contributing to OSS, you can help to make something better, more useful, and help you learn new things.  
- A few ways to get involved in contributing to OSS is by following open-source projects online, build on your favorite projects by other developers, and make a suggestion, fix, improve documentation, contribute code, or ask questions.  

- Motivations for contributing to OSS can include improving one’s coding skills, gaining early experience, increase community and peer recognition, gaining greater job prospects, and improving software on a user and business level.  
- For new developers, contributing to OSS can allow you to practice your coding skills.  
- Open-source software contributions give you the opportunity to improve your coding skills outside of your profession, and on real-world projects.  
- New developers can gain more experience by learning to read code written by other developers, find and fix bugs, and add their code to a main repository.  
- Working on OSS can also give you the opportunity to be noticed by peer developers and to work on projects you’re passionate about.  
- It also opens up greater job prospects because you’re able to be seen by people who may be in a position to hire you or recommend you to be hired.  
- Open-source software can also give you the opportunity to contribute to improving software at the user and business levels.  
- As a user of the software, you have the user-level perspective to be able to let those at the business-level know of improvements that could be made. These can lead to business-level improvements that affect the overall business or organization.
