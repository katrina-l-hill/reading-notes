React Lifecycle
-	The lifecycle of React encompasses the various methods used to define the classes or functions.
-	The lifecycle can be used at various stages of React.
-	The 3 phases of the lifecycle are Mounting, Updating, and Unmounting.
-	Mounting refers to the component being created and added into the DOM.
-	Updating is when the component is changed.
-	Unmounting is when the component is removed from the DOM.
React Lifecycle Questions:
1.	Based off the diagram, what happens first, the ‘render’ or the ‘componentDidMount’? The render occurs before componentDidMount.
2.	What is the very first thing to happen in the lifecycle of React? Creating and calling the constructor is the very first thing to happen.
3.	Put the following things in the order they happen: componentDidMount, render, constructor, componentWillUnmount, React Updates.  1. constructor, 2. render, 3. React Updates, 4. componentDidMount, and 5. componentWillMount.
4.	What does componentDidMount do? It’s a method that’s used to add new values to the component. 
Video – React State Vs Props:
1.	What types of things can you pass in the props? What you want to initialize the component with and render.
2.	What is the big difference between props and state? Props are passed into a component (handled outside the component), while state is something handled inside the component.
3.	When do we re-render our application? When you change the state inside of the application.
4.	What are some examples of things that we could store in state? The property and value of the component.
