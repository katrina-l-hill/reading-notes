# Read - Django Models

## Using Models

- Models are the structure of data stored through a Python object.  
- They are the means by which Django web applications access and manage data.  
- The stored data can be structured by field types, default values, label text for forms, etc.  
- The model is independent of the underlying database.  

### Designing the LocalLibrary models

- In order to start coding models, you need to determine what data needs to be stored and what the relationships will be between the different objects (i.e., groups of related information).  
- Relationships can be defined as one-to-one (OneToOneField), one-to-many (ForeignKey), and many-to-many (ManyToManyField).  
- You will need to have separate models for every object.  
- You can also use models in a selection-list type option (e.g., drop-down) to that the information isn’t hard coded into the website.  
- The relationships between the models can be displayed using multiplicities, which are the maximum and minumum numbers presenty in the relationship.  

### Model primer

- The model.py file is typically where models are defined.  
- Models are implemented as subclasses of **django.db.models.Model”.  
- They can include fields, metadata, and methods.  
- Fields represent a column of data stored in a database.  
- Models can have any number of fields of any type.  
- Each record (row) in a database consists of one of each field value.  
- Queries and templates refere to the field name when being referenced.  
- Fields also have a labels.  
- Metadata can be used to declare a class called **class Meta**.  
- It can be used to control the default ordering of records returned when the model type if queried.  
- This is done by specifying the match order in a list of field names to the **ordering** attribute.  
- Methods are defined using the standard Python class method****str**()** in order to return a string that human-readable for each object.  
- The string represents individual records on the admin site.  

## Django Admin

- The admin site uses the models to automatically build the site so that it can be used to create, view, update, and delete records (CRUD).  
- This reduces development time and makes testing of the models easier.  

### Registering models

- In order to register models, you need to open the **admin.py** file, import django.contrib import admin (if it’s not already imported), then import the models for the project.  
- You will also need to add the calls to register each of the models, which typically start with **admin.site.register()**.  
- To log in to the admin site, you need to create a superuser with staff status enabled.  
- The superuser account is managed under the **manage.py** file.  
- The Python command to create the superuser is **python3 manage.py createsuperuser**, then restart the development server using **python3 manage.py runserver**.  
- Once the development server comes up, type in **admin** after the URL (i.e., <http://127.0.0.1:8000/admin>).
