# Read - Passing Functions as Props

## Lists and Keys

- In React, lists are like those in JavaScript, whereas a list of elements is created.
- The .map() function takes in the numbers from an array and creates the list.
- A list is rendered inside a component.
- A unique key is assigned so that the listed items can be attributed to it inside the .map() function.
- The key is a way for React to determine items that have been added or modified.

## Lists and Keys Questions

- What does .map() return? It returns a new array from items passed into it from a different array and returns a rendered list of data.
- If I want to loop through an array and display each value in JSX, how do I do that in React? Use curly braces {}.
- Each list item needs a unique key.
- What is the purpose of a key? A key is a way for React to determine items that have been added or modified.

## The Spread Operator

- The spread operator (…) is a quick way to copy or add items from one array into another array.
- It can be thought of to expand an array into separate arguments.

## The Spread Operator Questions

- What is the spread operator? It’s a way to add items to arrays and spread the array out into separate arguments.
- List 4 things that the spread operator can do. 1) Copy an array, 2) concat or combine arrays, 30 math functions, and 4) combine objects.
- Give an example of using the spread operator to combine two arrays. const objectOne = {hello: “😊”}, const objectTwo = {world: “😎”}, const objectThree = {…objectOne, …objectTwo}
- Give an example of using the spread operator to add a new item to an array.  
- Give an example of using the spread operator to combine two objects into one. let chocolate = [‘milk’, ‘dark’];, let otherChocolate = [‘white’]; let allChocolate = [‘white’, …chocolate];
