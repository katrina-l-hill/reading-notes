## Whiteboard Advice

- Communication during a whiteboard interview is essential for you to do while going through the process of answering the interviewers question.  
- It’s also the most important skill you can practice leading up to the interview.  
- These are the steps you want to do to effectively communicate during the interview and should be done before you start trying to solve the problem.  
- **First, restate the question.**  
- By restating the question, you are seeking affirmation that you understood what is being asked.  
- **Second, ask about edge cases.**  
- Take some time to think about the question, the inputs and expected outputs, and potential edge cases.  
- Ask the interviewer(s) about any edge cases. This shows you\’re thinking analytically and will work hard to prevent any bugs.  
- After inquiring about any edge cases, be sure to ask what the function should do.  
- **Third, ask about test cases.**  
- You should ask if there are any test cases the function should pass.
- This may be a necessary question to the interview, and the interviewer(s) should be expecting you to ask.  
- It will also show the interviewer(s) that you know about testing.  
- **Fourth, write pseudocode and ask if it makes sense.**  
- Make it known to your interviewer(s) that you will write pseudocode before you write actual code.  
- Here, you’ll want to write your pseudocode and check your logic, then ask the interviewer(s) if it makes sense.  
- Ensure you ask if it makes sense before you start writing code.  
- This is a great way to find out from the interviewer(s) if there are any flaws in your logic and could save you from making mistakes in your code.  
- In addition, if you have difficulty writing the code or don\’t get around to completing the code, the pseudocode could still afford you good markings for understanding the logic of what should be done.  
- **Fifth, write the actual code and ask if it looks good.**  
- Here is where you’ll convert your pseudocode into actual code.  
- You can do this by plugging Python code in where the pseudocode is.  
- If you have difficulty transferring the pseudocode into actual code, try asking the interviewer(s) for this information, but if they\’re not forthcoming with it, just state that you’ll leave it as pseudocode for the time being.  
- You can also ask if your solution looks good. Hopefully, the interviewer(s) will provide this information as assistance.  
- In addition, this plays into the importance of communication by being vocal about your process and seeking assistance on ways to improve your code.  
- **Lastly, ask for help if you\’re stuck.**  
- This step should not be overlooked and can show that you’re conscious of your limitations and know when to seek help.  
- Phrase the inquiry for help in such as way that you\’re asking for tips to help get you pointed in the right direction.  
- They may say no, but it doesn\’t hurt to ask.  
- **Bonus: communicate prior to the interview.**  
- There should be a human resources interview prior to the technical interview.  
- This is the time to ask if there will be a coding interview, and specifics of the coding interview (e.g., specific language, number of questions, style of questions, computer or actual whiteboard, standing or sitting, etc.).  
- It\’s also important to know that we\’re all human and everyone makes mistakes. No one is perfect.

- “Why ask data structures questions during the interviews when you don\’t use them during the actual job? How do you reconcile the two?”  
- “This is rooted in the assumption that interviews should be realistic. The more realistic the interview, the better it is. The challenge is that the point of an interview is to hire. A good interview is one that is predictive, and a good candidate experience. The end goal of an interview is to predict who you wan to hire. Who will be a good employee. That is what you should be focusing on.”
