# Read – Authentication & Production Server

## JSON Web Tokens

- JSON Web Tokens (JWTs) are a compact and self-contained way of securely transmitting information between two parties as a JSON object.  
- The information is digitally signed using a secret or public/private key pair.  
- Signed JWTs can verify the integrity of the information within it.  
- This differs from encrypted JWTs that hide the information.  
- By using JWTs that are signed using public/private key pairs, the signature certifies that the other party holding the private key is the one that signed it.  
- JWTs are useful for authorizing a user that has already logged in to a site, and each subsequent request to the site will allow them access to routes, services, and resources permitted with that token.  
- JWTs are also useful for securely transmitting information between parties.  
- A JWT consists of a Header, Payload, and Signature, all separated by dots. E.g., xxxxx.yyyyy.zzzzz.  
- The **Header** typically consists the type of token (i.e., JSON Web Token) and the signing algorithm being used (e.g., HMAC SHA256 or RSA).  
- The **Payload** consists of the claims, which are statements about an entity(typically the user) and additional data.  
- There are three types of claims: registered, public, and private.  
- Registered claims are a set of predefined claims that aren’t mandatory but recommended.  
- Public claims are defined at will by those using JWTs, but should be defined in a token registry or be defined as a URI in order to avoid collisions.  
- Private claims are custom claims that are created to share information between parties and are neither registered or public.  
- The **Signature** is created by taking the encoded header, the encoded payload, a secret, the algorithm specified in the header, and sign it.  
- JWTs works when a user successfully logs in using their credentials and is authenticated.  

## DRF JWT Authentication

- JWTs should never be exposed as they are likened to being a username and password.  
- JWTs are suitable for client-server applications.  
- JWTs can be implemented after setting up a DRF REST API project.  
- To implement them, you need to add the **rest_framework.authtoken** to INSTALLED_APPS in settings.py, and include the TokenAuthentication to REST_FRAMEWORK.  
- Once these are included, you need to migrate the database to create the table that will store he authentication tokens, create a super user, generate a token, then use the token.  
- The DRF provides an endpoint for users to request an authentication token using their username and password.  

## Django Runserver Is Not Your Production Server

- The local app is not meant to be used for production as it’s only built for convenience of testing in the development process.  
- This is because the production server has not been put through security audits or performance tests.  
- Using a Django web app in production is reliable, well tested, and seasoned.  
- A production stack consists of a dedicated web server and an application server.  
- The web server receives a users request from the server.  
- If the request is not for a static file, the web server passes the it to the application server.  
- The application server takes these requests and uses them to construct Python objects which are usable by Django.  
- The Django project has a file, uwsgi.py, that contains a function to be called by the application server.  
- The function gets a Python object representing the incoming request.  
- The function calls the code and produces a response object which is passed to the WSGI server.  
- The response is then translated into a HTTP response and passed back to the web server which delivers it to the user.
