# Read: List Comprehensions

## List Comprehensions

- List comprehensions are a way of shortening up code by combining **for** loops with an expression that creates a new list.  
- The shortened **for** loop code and expression make the code more readable and concise.  
- They’re also more flexible than a traditional for loop statement, and performs the algorithm fast.  
- List comprehensions are enclosed in square brackets [] and includes the keywords **for** and **in**.  
- No colon (:) is required at the end of the for loop statement.  

### Syntax

- There are three requirements to make a list comprehension: 1., an expression that creates the list, 2., the object in the expression that you want to store in the list, and 3., the list of objects from which the list will be built from.  
- Example: new_list = [item for item in list]  

### Create a List with range()

- new_list = [item for item in range(“a number”)] --> print(new_list)  

### Create a List Using Loops and List Comprehension in Python

- new_list_square = [item**2 for item in range(“a number”)] --> print(new_list_square)  

### Multiplying Parts of a List

- new_list_multiple_three = [item*2 for item in range(“a number”)] --> print(new_list_multiple_three)  

### Show the first letter of each word using Python

- fruit = [“kiwi”, “plum”, “apple”, “orange”, “grape”]  
- first_letter = [letter[0] for letter in fruit] --> print(first_letter) --> [“k”, “p”, “a”, “o”, “g”]

### Lower/Upper case converter in Python

- new_list_lower_case = [item.lower() for item in [‘B’, ‘T’, ‘S’]] --> print(new_list_lower_case) --> [“b”, “t”, “s”]  

- new_list_upper_case = [item.upper() for item in [‘t’, ‘x’, ‘t’]] --> print(new_list_upper_case) --> [“T”, “X”, “T”]  

### Print numbers only from a given string

- it_crowd = “Emergency Services 0118-999-881-999-119-7253”  
- new_number = [item for item in it_crowd if item.isdigit()] --> print(new_number) --> [“0”, “1”, “1”, “8”, “9”, “9”, “9”, “8”, “8”, “1”. “9”, “9”, “9”, “1”, “1”, “9”, “7”, “2”, “5”, “3”]  

### Parsing a file using list comprehensions

Oh, the dead don't die  
Any more than you or I  
They're just ghosts inside a dream  
Of a life that we don't own  
They walk around sometimes  
Never payin' any mind  
To the silly lives we lead  
Or the reaping we've all sown  
There's a cup of coffee waiting on every corner  
Someday we're gonna wake up and find the corner's gone  
But the dead will still be walking 'round this ol' world alone  
Oh, well after life is over the afterlife goes on  
_Singer: Sturgill Simpson_  

- file = open(“the_dead_don’t_die.txt”, “r”)  
- lyrics = [line for line in file]  
- for line in lyrics: --> print(line) →  
Oh, the dead don't die  
Any more than you or I  
They're just ghosts inside a dream  
Of a life that we don't own  
They walk around sometimes  
Never payin' any mind  
To the silly lives we lead  
Or the reaping we've all sown  
There's a cup of coffee waiting on every corner  
Someday we're gonna wake up and find the corner's gone  
But the dead will still be walking 'round this ol' world alone  
Oh, well after life is over the afterlife goes on  
_Singer: Sturgill Simpson_  

### Using functions in list comprehensions

- doubled_num = [double(num) for num in range(1, 10)] --> print(double_num) --> [“2”, “4”, “6”, “8”, “10”, “12”, “14”, “16”, “18”]
