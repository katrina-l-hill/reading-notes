## Django Settings Best Practices

### Managing Django Settings: Issues

- Below are different types of issues that may arise while managing a Django project and need to be taken into consideration or mitigated.  
- There are many different environments to deal with in Django. These include local, development, continuous integration (CI), quality assurance (QA), staging, and production.  
- Each of these environments have their own settings, so it’s important to keep track of which settings need to be changed where.  
- Each Django project has a **SECRET_KEY** that cannot be stored in a version control system.  
- In addition, there may be database passwords as well as tokens for third-party APIs that also cannot be stored in a version control system.  
- Working in a team can present issues when interacting with a single Django project.  
- It’s important to have a approach to managing project settings to ensure potential human errors are addressed and mitigated.  

### Setting Configuration: Different Approaches

- It’s difficult to get around hardcoding Django settings.  
- Typical settings that need to be hardcoded are settings_local.py, individual environment settings, and environment variables.  
- Settings_local.py is the oldest Django method. It extends all environment-specific settings.  
- Settings_local.py is ignored by the version control system.  
- Areas where this file can cause issues include that it is not in the version control system, so you can lose some of the project Django settings and it can have some non-obvious logic as it is Python code.  
- Separate settings file each environment allows you to keep all configurations in the version control system and share default settings with other developers.  
- Drawbacks to this is that you need to determine how to handle secret passwords and tokens and inheritance of setting can be hard to trace and maintain.  
- Environment variables are a way to address the handling of secret passwords and tokens and inheritance of settings.  
- Some benefits of using environment variables is that the configuration is separated from code, there is no inheritance in settings, and you can have the same code for all environments.  
- A drawback to using environment variables is that you still need a way to share the default settings with other developers.  

### Django Settings: Best Practices

- The following recommendations will help to ensure Django project issues are minimized.  
- Place settings in environment variables.  
- Use default values for production configuration (don’t include secret passwords and tokens).  
- Don’t put sensitive settings in the version control system.  
- Split up the project settings (i.e., Django, third-party, project).  
- Follow naming conventions for custom project settings.  

## SSH Tutorial

- Secure Shell Protocol (SSH) is a protocol for securely and remotely accessing, controlling, and modifying servers over the internet.  
- It provides a way to authenticate remote users, transfer input from client to host, and relay output back to the client.  
- The host is the remote server being accessed and the client is the computer from where you are trying to access the host.  
- SSH allows you to execute shell commands as if you were doing them physically on the remote computer.  
- There are three different encryption technologies used by SSH: Symmetrical encryption, Asymmetrical encryption, and Hashing.  
- Symmetrical encryption (aka shared key or shared secret encryption) is when one secret key is used to encrypt and decrypt a message by both the client and the host.  
- Asymmetrical encryption uses two separate keys for encryption and decryption.  
- These keys are known as the public key and the private key. Together they form a public-private key pair.  
- Hashing is a one-way form on encryption, and is not intended for decryption.
