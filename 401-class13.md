## How to Run Linear Regression in Python

- Linear regression is an approach/equation that models the linear relationship between two variables.  
- To use the linear regression approach/equation in Python, you can use the _scikit-learn_ library.  
- Scikit-learn is built upon NumPy, pandas, and Matplotlib.  
- It has the following functionality: regression, classification, clustering, model selection, and dimensionality reduction.  
- The sklearn-linear_model module has methods to perform linear regression on input variables.

- Linear regression is a machine learning technique that does statistics, scientific computations, etc.  
- Regression analysis is fundamental to statistics and machine learning.  
- Regression is where you can search for relationships among variables. Essentially, how different things are connected or interact with each other.  
- There are two types of features in regression analysis used in functions: dependent and independent.  
- Dependent features are variables, outputs, or responses.  
- Independent features are variables, inputs, or predictors.  
- Problems solved using regression analysis are usually have one continuous and unbounded variable.  
- Inputs can be continuous, discrete, or categorical.  
- Regression is needed when you want to answer a question as to how a phenomenon influences another one, or how several variables are related, as well as when you want to predict a response using a set of predictors.  
- Linear regression is the most important, simplest, and widely used technique.  
- The regression equation is where you have a set of independent variables implemented on a dependent variable. You assume the relationship between the dependent and independent variables are linear.  
- Regression equations also contain regression coefficients.  
- Simple or simple-variant linear regression is the simplest case of linear regression with a single independent variable.  
- To implement simple linear regression, you start with a given set of input-output pairs.  
- Multiple or multivariate linear regression has two or more independent variables.  
- Polynomial regression is a dependence between the output and inputs.  

## Implementing Linear Regression in Python

- The NumPy Python package contains mathematical routines and allows high-performance operations on single- and multidimensional arrays.  
- The scikit-learn library has the ability to do preprocessing of data, reducing dimensionality, implementing regression, classification, clustering, etc.
