## Python Regular Expressions Tutorial

- Regular expressions (regex) are characters used to check strings for matches to a pattern.  
- Regex are used on the server side to valid data such as email addresses, passwords, etc.  
- Regex can be used to manipulate textual data.  
- To use regex in Python you need to use the “import re” library, which supports regex.  
- Ordinary characters are the simplest to use and match themselves exactly. Ex: ‘A’, ‘a’, ‘X’, ‘5’.  
- They do not have a special meaning.  
- The match function will return a match object if the text matches the pattern. If there is no match, it returns None.  
- The lowercase letter “r” called a “raw string literal.” It will change how the string literal is interpreted.  
- Special characters are considered wildcard characters that do not match themselves but have special meaning when used in a regular expression.  
- Special characters are period (.), caret (^), dollar sign ($), [abc], [a-zA-Z0-9], backslash (\), plus sign (+), asterisk (*), and question mark (?).  
- Special characters can be used with the search() and group() functions.  
- The search() function allows you to scan through a string or sequence looking for the first location where the regex expression results in a match.  
- The group() function returns a string that’s matched with the regex (re) pattern.  
- Regex parts are grouped bounded together by parentheses ().  
- Parentheses allow you to group expressions within the matched sequence.  
- Matching characters can be considered as “greedy” or “non-greedy.”  
- Greedy matching characters are when a special character matches as much of a string as possible.  
- Functions provided by “re” include:  
- compile(pattern, flags=0) → use an expression several times in a single program  
- search(pattern, string, flags=0) → scan through a string or sequence looking for the first location where the regex expression results in a match.  
- match(pattern, string, flags=0) → returns a corresponding match object if zero is more characters at the beginning of the string that matches the pattern.  
- findall(pattern, string, flags=0) → finds all the possible matches in the entire sequence and returns them as a list of strings.  
- finditer(string, [position, end_position]) → finds all the possible matches in the entire sequence but returns regex match objects as an iterator.  
- sub(pattern, repl, string, count=0, flags=0) → substitute function that returns the string obtained by replacing or substituting the leftmost non-overlapping occurrences of the pattern in the string by the replacement repl.  
- subn(patter, repl, string, count=0) → substitute function that returns a tuple containing the new string value and the number of replacements that were performed in the statement.  
- split(string, [maxsplit = 0]) → splits the strings wherever the pattern matches and returns a list.  
- start() → returns the starting index of the match.  
- end() → returns the index where the match ends.  
- span()  → returns a tuple containing the (start, end) positions of the match.  

## Shutil

- The Python shutil module performs many high-level operations on files.  
- Operations such as copying and archiving files.  
- The shutil.copyfile() method copies the source contents to a destination and raises an input-output error it it doesn’t have permission to write the file contents to the destination.  
- The shutil.get_archive_formats() method returns a sequence of names and descriptions for formats supported on the current system.  
- The supported formats depend on the modules and underlying libraries available.
