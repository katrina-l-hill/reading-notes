## Component-based Architecture

## Props and How to Use in React

- Component-based architecture is where website design is broken down into smaller, logical components that contain methods, events, and properties.
- When compared to object-oriented programming, component-based architecture provides a higher-level view of problem set but broken down into manageable sections.
- Components are bits of code, like functions or classes in JavaScript. 
- Components are also objects.
- Characteristics of components are that they are reusable, replaceable, not specific to a particular environment or context, can be extended, encapsulated to use functionality, and can be independent of other components.
- Advantages of using components include the ability to be deployed easily so as not to impact older versions, not costly, easily deployed, reusable, easily modified, reliable, can be maintained and evolved easily, and independent and flexible for connecting to other components.


## Props and How to Use in React

- “Props” stands for “properties” and is a keyword in React.
- Props are used to pass data from a parent to a child.
- The flow of props flows in one direction from parent to child. It cannot flow the other way around or back-and-forth.

## Tutorial: Intro to React

- React is a JavaScript library used to build a user interface. 
- You can pass different types of parameters through it such as declarations.
- It makes code easier to reuse and ensures the one direction flow of data from parent to child.

## JSX

- JSX stands for JavaScript XML and is an extension of JavaScript.
- It’s typically used with React for to display the user interface.
- JSX utilizes curly braces {} with an expression in-between.
- It’s also a great visual tool for seeing any errors in your code.


## Rendering Elements

- “Elements are the smallest building blocks of React apps” (Meta Platforms, Inc., 2022). 
- Elements allow you to display code plainly, and for the user, it’s what you see on the screen.
- Elements are rendered through the React Document Object Model (DOM), which allows the elements to be seen in a certain format or style on the webpage.

## Components and Props

- As described above, components have many characteristics and advantages.
- Regarding props, components can be used independently to pass props into React and return elements that you see on the screen.
