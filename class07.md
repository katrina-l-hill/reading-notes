## Reading Overview 07

### Domain Modeling

- Domain modeling is a model of a domain that shows the process, attributes, behaviors, and constrains of a problem domain.
- A domain model can be a communication tool if it’s articulated well and can validate a specific problem.
- A constructor function allows you to define properties between many objects.
- The construction function is defined using a function expression.
- A function expression is used to define a function.  
- Methods can be added to a construction function’s prototype.

### HTML book

#### Tables

- A table is information laid out in tables and rows in a grid format.
- The rows in the grids have cells called table cells and are created with the table data (td) and table heading (th) tags.
- Tables can span several rows or columns and be long with may rows.
- The “width” attribute can be used to change the width and spacing of the table.
- The “border” attribute can be used to change the border and background.

### JavaScript book

#### Functions, Methods, and Objects

- To create a blank object, the “new” keyword and object constructor can be used.
- Properties and methods can be added to the new object.
- There are two ways to update the value of properties: dot notation and square brackets.
- In dot notation, a period follows the object and comes before the property name. An assignment operator is next, then the property value is added as a string.
- In square brackets, the property name is enclosed in brackets next to the object name. The assignment operator is added followed by the property value as a string.
- The keyword “this” is used inside functions and objects.
- You can replace an objects name with “this” to indicate that a property or methods belongs to the object that “this” function creates.
- “This” only refers to one object.
- Arrays are an object that holds relates sets of key/value pairs.
- Built-in objects represent things such as the browser winder and the current web page.
- There are three types of built-in objects: browser object model, document object model, and global JavaScript objects.
- An object model is a group of objects that represent related things.
