# Read - Thinking in React, Higher-Order Functions

## React Docs - Thinking in React

- To understand how to build apps in React, it’s helpful to walk through the process.
- The first step in the process is to identify the components and subcomponents and separate visually so that you can see the hierarchy. You can do this by drawing boxes around them.
- To identify and separate them, you can follow along the same rationale for creating a new function or object.
- By separating the components in the UI, you ensure that each component only does one thing, which adheres to the “single responsibility principle”.
- The second step in the process is to render what you’ve coded and into a user interface (UI) that’s static, which means it has no interactivity.
- To render what you’ve coded, you’ll need to pass data using props, which passes data from the parent to the child.
- In the render, make sure you don’t use state, which is when you want data to be able to change.
- When building, the hierarchy order is up to you. You can either start with a class declaration or the data that gets pushed into the array.
- Step 3 in the process is to make the UI interactive, which is to add in the state. This is done by adding state so that the data can be triggered to change.
- You need to think about what data will need to change over time.
- The fourth step in the process is to determine which of the components will have control over the state created in step 3.
- To do this, you need to identify the components that will render something based on the state, find the main component that will need the state, identify which component (it could be the main one or another one further up the hierarchy) should own the state, or you could create a new component to own the state of the existing ones don’t make sense to be the owner.
- The fifth and last step is to get the data flowing in the opposite direction, which means the components further down in the hierarchy need to update the state.
- To do this, you need to make it so that the state is updated with user input. The state passed in from the class declaration will pass callbacks whenever the state is updated.
- The callbacks will then call the setState so that the app will be updated.

## React Docs - Thinking of React Questions

1. What is the single responsibility principle? It’s a software programming principle that says modules, classes, and functions in object-oriented programming should only do one thing.
2. What does it mean to build a ‘static’ version of your application? It means to build a version that does not change. The application is in a fixed state; not dynamic.
3. Once you have a static application, what do you need to add? You need to pass data using props, which passes data from the parent to the child.
4. What are the three questions you can ask to determine if something is a state? 1) Is it passed in from a parent via props?, 2) Does it remain unchanged over time?, and 3) Can you compute it based on any other state or props in your component?
5. How can you identify where state needs to live? You need to determine which of the components will have control over the state.

## Higher-Order Functions

- Higher-order functions operate on other functions by either taking them in as arguments or returns a function as its result.
- They can create new functions, change other functions, or write provide new types of control flow, which means how a function is executed or evaluated.

## Higher-Order Functions Questions

1. What is a “higher-order function”? A function that operates on other functions by either taking them in as arguments or returns a function as its result.
2. What is line 2 of the greaterThan function doing?  It’s returning the value of “m” where “m” is greater than the value of “n.”
3. Explain how either map() or reduce() operates, with regards to higher-order functions. The map() method creates a new array taking in another function as its argument.
