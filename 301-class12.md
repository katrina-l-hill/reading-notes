## Status Codes Based on REST Methods
- Status codes are a way of communicating with the client through the web page by telling them if their request has been successful or not.
- The codes range from 100 to 600.
- The codes are broken down into status classes which are further broken down into groups by the hundreds.
- Status class 100-199 tell the client that the header part of the request has been received and the server will try to comply with a request from the client.
- Status class 200-299 denote successful/accepted requests from the client. 
- Status class 300-399 tell the client that the information they’re requesting isn’t available at the location anymore.
- Status class 400-499 are error codes on the client side. They tell the client they’ve made an invalid request to the server. These denote there is something wrong with the information they’re sending to the server.
- Status class 500-599 tell the client there is an error on the server side. The error can be that the server is overloaded with requests, the proxies are unreachable, or that the client’s requests have triggered error exceptions on the server. These errors can be temporary or permanent. The client can attempt the same request again.
- Custom classes above 599 are not allowed but may be used by some services.
