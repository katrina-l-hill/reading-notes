## Understanding the JavaScript Call Stack
- The JavaScript call stack is a way that JavaScript manages the execution of a function.
- Essentially, it’s how a function is called and executed.
- The call stack works in a singular, synchronous order, and follows the last in, first out (LIFO) principle.
- This means functions are executed and returned based on the last one that was called. So, the first one that was called, will be executed last, after the most recent functions are executed and returned.
- A stack frame is where called functions, and their parameters and variables, are pushed to wait to be executed.
- Essentially, a stack frame is a memory location.
- When the function has been executed/returned, it is cleared and removed from the called stack.
- The call stack is also a record of where called functions are placed in the stack frame.
- The call stack has a fixed size, which means it can only handle so many function calls to execute and return.
- If there are too many function calls being sent for execution, which can occur if the function doesn’t have a return (exit point), a stack overflow occurs.
- Essentially, a stack overflow occurs when the number of functions calls exceeds the size of the call stack.
- When a function doesn’t have a return, or exit point, it ends up calling itself, which is called a recursive function.

## Understanding the JavaScript Call Stack
1. What is a ‘call’? A call is when you tell a function to run.
2. How many ‘calls’ can happen at once? Only one call can happen at once.
3. What does LIFO mean? Last in, First out
4. Draw an example of a call stack and the functions that would need to be invoked to generate that call stack.
5. What causes a Stack Overflow? It’s caused when the number of functions calls exceeds the size of the call stack, and the function doesn’t have an exit point.
