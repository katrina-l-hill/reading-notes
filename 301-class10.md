## Understanding the JavaScript Call Stack
- The JavaScript call stack is a way that JavaScript manages the execution of a function.
- Essentially, it’s how a function is called and executed.
- The call stack works in a singular, synchronous order, and follows the last in, first out (LIFO) principle.
- This means functions are executed and returned based on the last one that was called. So, the first one that was called, will be executed last, after the most recent functions are executed and returned.
- A stack frame is where called functions, and their parameters and variables, are pushed to wait to be executed.
- Essentially, a stack frame is a memory location.
- When the function has been executed/returned, it is cleared and removed from the called stack.
- The call stack is also a record of where called functions are placed in the stack frame.
- The call stack has a fixed size, which means it can only handle so many function calls to execute and return.
- If there are too many function calls being sent for execution, which can occur if the function doesn’t have a return (exit point), a stack overflow occurs.
- Essentially, a stack overflow occurs when the number of functions calls exceeds the size of the call stack.
- When a function doesn’t have a return, or exit point, it ends up calling itself, which is called a recursive function.

## Understanding the JavaScript Call Stack Questions
1. What is a ‘call’? A call is when you tell a function to run.
2. How many ‘calls’ can happen at once? Only one call can happen at once.
3. What does LIFO mean? Last in, First out
4. Draw an example of a call stack and the functions that would need to be invoked to generate that call stack.
5. What causes a Stack Overflow? It’s caused when the number of functions calls exceeds the size of the call stack, and the function doesn’t have an exit point.

## JavaScript error messages
- The first indication of an error in your code is an error message.
- The error typically appears in the console.
- A ‘reference error’ is given if you use a variable this is not declared yet.
- It’s common when using variables const and let. 
- A ‘syntax error’ is given you have code that cannot be parsed in terms of syntax.
- A ‘range error’ is given when you try to give an object an invalid length.
- A ‘type error’ is given when the types of code you are trying to use or access are incompatible (e.g., number, string, etc.).
- To debug JavaScript code, you could use console.log() the variables you want to check, Google Chrome developer tools, debug in JavaScript, add breakpoints.
- A call stack is the path the program takes to reach an error.
- Handling errors can be done by using try and catch to get to a default state of the application in case of an error.

## JavaScript error messages Questions
1. What is a ‘reference error’? If you use a variable this is not declared yet.
2. What is a ‘syntax error’? If you have code that cannot be parsed in terms of syntax.
3. What is a ‘range error’? When you try to give an object an invalid length.
4. What is a ‘tyep error’? when the types of code you are trying to use or access are incompatible (e.g., number, string, etc.).
5. What is a breakpoint? A debugging statement.
6. What does the word ‘debugger’ do in your code? It stops the execution of JavaScript and calls the debugging statement.
