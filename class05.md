#### Images

- Adding images to your website is a great way to welcome an audience to your site.
- Using images can convey information about your site, such as what product or service you offer or who the employees or leadership are.
- There are many things to consider before adding images to your page:
  - The theme for the website,
  - How many images to include,
  - Where the images will be situated, and
  - What images to choose
- After that, you’ll need to figure out the placement of the code for the images, size,  and alignment.
- There are three types of images: joint photographic experts group (JPEG), graphics interchange format (GIF), and portable network graphics (PNG).
- Make sure to save images in the size and format you want them to appear on your website.

#### Color

- Color can displayed in the foreground, background, or both.
- It’s displayed in red-green-blue (RGB) values, hexadecimal (HEX) codes, or color names.
- RGB values tell you how much red, green, and blue is in a particular color.
- HEX codes are comprised of a pound sign (#) in front of six digits of letters and numbers that also tell you how much red, green, and blue is in a color.
- Color names is the name of a color. HTML is comprised of 147 color names you can choose from for your website.
- In addition to picking a color, you can modify the color by changing the hue, saturation, brightness, and contrast.
- Hue can be thought of as the lightness or darkness of a color.
- Saturation can be thought of as how sharp or intense a color is.
- Brightness refers to how much black color is mixed into another color.
- Contrast refers to how the foreground and background colors interact with each other. It can affect how easy or difficult text is to read on a website.
- In CSS3, there are two types of color properties: opacity, hue-saturation-lightness (HSL), and hue-saturation-lightness-alpha model (HSLA).
- Opacity refers to how see-through an image or text is on top of or beneath something.
- HSL is another numerical representation of color.
- HSLA is similar to HSL but includes opacity.

#### Text

- The text on a page can be displayed with different appearances called typeface.
- Typeface refers to how the letters look, as far as design.
- There are five types of typefaces: Serif, Sans-Serif, Monospace, Cursive, and Fantasy.
- Each of these typefaces make the text look plain or stylish.
- In order to display typefaces in HTML, you’ll need to use the “font-family” property.
- You can change the size of font by using “font-size.”
- With font-size, there are three ways to display it: pixels, percentages, and emphasis.
- In HTML, you can display text in bold, italic, lower- and upper-case, underlined, and struck-through.
- Text can be spaced, vertically aligned, and indented.

#### Blog Post

- Compression of a webpage refers to how the content is sized for faster transmission over the internet.
- Compression can be applied to text, images, and videos.
- There are two types of compression: lossless and lossy.
- Lossless compression means information can be compressed and not lose information.
- Lossy compression means information can be compressed but data will be lost which will affect how the data appears.
- JPEGs are a type of lossy compression image format. There is a certain threshold where a JPEG image can be compressed, and the data lost is not perceived that much. After that point, data lost is noticed.
- JPEGs work best for photographs and paintings where there are smooth variations in color and intensity.
- GIFs are a type of lossless compression image format. GIFs are primarily used for animations.
- PNGs are also a type of lossless compression image format. There is a higher data quality with PNGs and has a sharper image than JPEGs.
- However, PNGs are large files and take up a lot of room on your computer.
