# Read - React and Forms

## React Docs - Forms

- Forms are a way for users to interact with a website.
- Just like JavaScript, there is a form element.
- The React component that renders the form can also control what the form does.
- Unlike JavaScript, React forms have a the ability to change state in the state property. It’s only updated with using the setState() method.  
- The setState()method queues up changes to a component’s state so that it and its children can be re-rendered with the changes.
- React uses two kinds of components: controlled and uncontrolled.
- Controlled components are used to implement form data. The component’s state acts as the “single source of truth” to control the flow of data.
- Uncontrolled components store input in the DOM so an onChange event is not needed to trigger a change in state.

## React Docs - Forms Questions

- What is a ‘Controlled Component’? A controlled component is one where the data is controlled by the state in React.
- Should we wait to store the users responses from the form into state when they submit the form OR should we update the state with their responses as soon as soon as they enter them? Why? We should update the state as soon as the user enters them, so the updates are rendered as soon as they occur.
- How do we target what the user is entering if we have an event handler on an input field? event.target.name

## The Conditional (Ternary) Operator Explained

- The ternary operator is a simplified version of the if statement.
- It allows you to use one line of code to state the same thing as the if statement.
- The ternary operator consists of a condition, then a question mark (?), then a colon (:).
- The condition is what is being tested. It will result in a true or false Boolean value.
- The question mark (?) following the condition denotes what would be true about the condition.
- The colon (:) denotes what would be false about the condition.

## The Conditional (Ternary) Operator Explained Questions

- Why would use a ternary operator? We would use a ternary operator to simplify an if statement for executing code that is either true or executing code that is false.
- Rewrite the following statement using a ternary statement: (condition) ?  condition === ‘x’ : condition === ‘y’;
