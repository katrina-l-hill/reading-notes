## Pain and Suffering

- The biggest takeaway I got from this reading is that pain is gain.  
- You can’t expect to gain anything in life without pain.  
- In order to make it through the pain, you have to know what you’re in pain for, which is your purpose.  
- We should not think that we are suffering in this class. To think that means that we have no purpose or higher goal for doing what we’re doing, learning what we’re learning, or to have a dream, ambition, or aspiration for what comes next.  
- While experiencing the pain of this course, it’s important to remember our “why.” Why we’re here and why we’re allowing ourselves to be put through this pain.  
- Software development is a very different career field from environmental science, and I’ve already experienced the pain of this career switch in the 102, 201, and 301 courses. I’ve made it this far, and I’m hoping to finish this Python course out strong and better than before I started.  

## Beginners Guide to Big O

- _Big O notation_ is a mathematical, algebraic, notation for describing some types of algorithms in computer science.  
- It describes what the worst-case scenario is of an algorithm and execution.  
- O(1) refers to an algorithm that will execute a constant time independent of the data input size.  
- O(N) refers to an linear growing algorithm in proportion to it’s data input size.  
- O(N2) refers to an algorithm performing in proportion to the square of it’s data input size.  
- O(2^N) refers to an algorithm growth doubling with each addition to the data input size.  
- Logarithms (O(log N)) are where the data input size is halved to produce a growth curve that has a peak near the beginning and gradually flattens out as the data input increases.

## Video – Names and Values in Python

- Python works like other languages.  
- There are surprises that will trip you up when compared to other languages.  
- The mechanisms are simple but can have surprising effects.  
- Names refer to values.  
- Assignments make the names refer to the value.
