## In Tests We Trust – TDD with Python

- Unit tests are conducted to test out the input, output, and behavior of code. Essentially, to put the code through its paces.    
- Test-Driven Development (TDD) is a strategy used to think about how you want the unit tests to be conducted and write down that strategy, before you actually test the code.  
- When conducting unit tests, you need to be aware of the name of the test, or how you describe the test.  
- To make things clear, the file name and the module name should follow the same type of naming convention for ease of testing.  
- In addition, it’s important to separate the unit test folder from the production code so you don’t get confused on what you’re doing.  
- The structure of the unit test organization is also important. The typical structure is as follows: Arrange, Act, and Assert (AAA).  
- Arrange means to the executable data (input).  
- Act means to execute the input.  
- Assert means to check that the output of the executed and tested code to see if it met your expectations of what it was supposed to do.  
- The Test-Driven Development strategy has a cycle of how it should be done. This cycle is comprised of three steps.  
- Step 1: Write a unit test and make it so that it fails.  
- Step 2: Write the unit test so that it passes.  
- Step 3: Refactor the code so that it it reads better.  

## What does the if __name__ == “__main__”: do?

- Python reads a source file and defines some special or global variables.  
- The special variable can be given a name of __name__ with its variable set to __main__.  
- If the source file is imported from another module, then __name__ will be set to the imported module’s name.  
- Then, the module’s name becomes a global variable so __name__ can use it.  

## Recursion

- Recursion is when a function calls itself directly or indirectly.  
- A function that contains the recursion is called a recursive function.  
- Recursion can be a helpful process for programmers because it allows them to solve problems an easy and efficient way.  
- This process is useful because it allows you to break a problem down into smaller, more manageable problems to troubleshoot on.  
- Recursive functions must have a base case so as to escape the recursion.  
- The difference between direct and indirect recursion is that with direct recursion the function calls the same function, whereas with indirect recursion, the function calls another function.
