## Next.js – Dynamic Routes

- Next.js allows you to statically generate data with paths that depend on external data.  
- This will enable dynamic URLs.  
- You can pre-render pages with paths that depend on external data. This occurs by fetching the external data, building the apps for production, then generating the pages that have specific paths.  
- In Next.js, dynamic routes begin and end with brackets (**[ ]**).  
- To render markdown content in Next.js, you’ll need to install and import the **remark** library.  
- You can fetch data from an external API endpoint.  
- To run the development environment, you can type **npm run dev** and the **getStaticPaths** will run on **every request**.  
- In the production environment, **getStaticPaths** runs at **build time**.  
- When **fallback: false** is returned, this means that any paths returned by **getStaticPaths** will result in a 404 page error.  
- When **fallback: true** is returned, this means the paths returned by **getStaticPaths** will be rendered to HTML at build time, a 404 page error will not be generated but a “fallback” version of the page will be served on the first request, and in the background, Next.js will statically generate the required path.  
- Subsequent requests to the same path will serve the generated page, just like other pages pre-rendered at build time.  
- Adding three dots (**...**) inside the brackets will extend the dynamic routes as a catch all.  
- Use the **useRouter** hook from **next/router** to access the Next.js router.  
- You can create custom 404 pages by creating the **pages/404.js** files, which is statically generated at build time.  

## Next.js – Deployment

- Before deployment, ensure you’ve pushed your Next. Js app to GitHub to make deployment easier.  
- Ensure a **nextjs-blog** file was created in previous steps.  
- The easiest say to deploy Next.js to production is to use the Vercel platform which was developed by the creators of Next.js.  
- After creating a Vercel account, import your **nextjs-blog** repository on Vercel.  
- To do this, install Vercel for GitHub and give access to all repositories.  
- Use the default values for the following settings: Project Name, Root Directory, Build Command, Output Directory, and Development Command.  
- When you deploy, your Next.js app will start building.  
- When the deployment and build are done, deployment URLs are generated. You can click on one of the URLs to see the live Next.js starter page.  
- By default upon deployment, pages that use Static Generation and assess such as JavaScript, CSS, images, fonts, etc. will automatically be served from the Vercel Edge Network, and pages that use Server-Side Rendering and API routes will automatically become isolated Serverless Functions. This allows page rendering and API requests to scale infinitely.  
- The whole process can be summed up as Develop, Preview, and Ship (DPS).  
- Develop is where code has been written in Next.js and uses the Next.js development server running in order to take advantage of its hot reloading feature.  
- Preview is where you’ve pushed changes to a branch on GitHub and Vercel created a preview deployment that’s available via a URL.  
- Ship is where you’ve merged the pull request to **main** to ship to production.  
- Next.js can be deployed to other hosting providers that support Node.js.  
- The **package.json** file should have the **build** and **start** scripts, which can be used by other hosting providers.  
- Running the **build** script once in other hosting providers will build the production application in the **.next** folder.  
- After building, the **start** script starts a Node.js server that supports hybrid pages, serving both statically generated and server-side rendered pages, and API routes.

## Bookmark and Review – Next.js – Static File Serving

- Next.js can serve static files such as images under a folder called **public** in the root directory.  
- Files inside this folder can be referenced by your code starting from the base URL **/**.  
- If you had an image, you will need to import **Image** from **next/image**.  
- Keep in mind that **next/image** requires Next.js 10 or later.  
- The **public** directory cannot be names anything else as it’s used  to serve static assets.  
- Also, make sure you don’t have a static file with same name as a file in the **pages/** directory as this will result in an error.  
- Only assets in the **public** directory at build time will be served by Next.js.  
- Any files added at runtime will not be available.  
- You can use a third party service like AWS S3 for persistence file storage.
