# Read: Random Module, Risk Analysis, Test Coverage

## How to use Random Module

- The random module is used to generate random numbers or to choosing random elements in a list.  
- The random module includes the following functions: randint, choice, shuffle, and randrange.  
- The randint() function is used to generate random integers, and it accepts to parameters (a low and a high number).  
- The choice() function will return a random item from a list.  
- The shuffle() function takes in a list and shuffles the elements.  
- The randrange() function will return a random element from a list within a specified range.  

## What is Risk Analysis

- Risk analysis is the process of identifying potential issues in code and determining the unit test priority for the issues.  
- Once the risk analysis has been completed, a level of risk needs to be assigned to each issue.  
- Conducting a risk analysis prior to starting a project can identify problem areas before you began coding thereby allowing you to mitigate the issues beforehand.  
- Some issues you may run into to consider in a project’s risk analysis include: new hardware, technology, and automation tools, code sequence, and test resource availability.  
- Unavoidable issues include: time and space complexity, size of the application, client demands/input, and incomplete requirements.  
- To help address these issues, these considerations should be made: conduct a risk assessment review meeting, create a risk assessment database, identify and categorize risk magnitude indicators.  
- The levels of risk magnitude indicators are high (i.e., risk is not tolerable), medium (risk is tolerable but not desirable), and low (risk is tolerable).  
- The types of risk identified in the process are business (most common), testing, premature release, and software.  
- Risk assessment is the most important aspect of risk analysis and should be dealt with programmatically.  
- The 3 perspectives of risk assessment are effect (identify a condition, event, or action and try to determine its impact), cause (review the problem and get to a narrow done to a probable reason for the problem), likelihood (there is a probability that the requirement won’t be satisfied).  
- There are 3 steps to perform a risk analysis: searching the risk, analyzing the impact of each individual rist, and measures for the risk identified.  

## Test coverage

- Test coverage is the process of finding untested code.  
- Trying to get high test coverage can be easy to attain but at the cost of low quality testing.  
- By trying to get all tests to pass, you may miss the things that are important.  
- You don’t have to get all tests to pass to get sufficient test coverage. Test coverage in the high 80s or 90s is adequate for testing.  
- To get all tests to pass could make it seem like tests were written so they would pass.  
- When testing, if you are rarely getting bugs that get past into production and you get to a point where you don’t hesitate to change code for fear of breaking it, then you are doing enough testing.  

## Video – Big O Notation

- Big O is an equation that describes the period of time with respect to data input.  
- Transferring data over the internet takes longer depending on how much data is being transferred.  
- O(1) is constant time regardless of the size of the data input. It doesn’t take longer with more input.  
- O(n) is scaled linearly with more data input.  
- 4 rules of Big O: 1. Add up different steps in a function (i.e., different complexities), 2. Don’t use constants, 3. Use different variables for different inputs, and 4. Don’t use non-dominant terms.  

## Bookmark and Review – Python Random

- In pseudo-random number generators, integers have a uniform selection from a range and sequences have a uniform selection of a random element.  
- Most module functions depend on the random() function.  
- The random() function generates a floating number between 0.0 and 1.0.  
- The random() function has the class Random, and subclasses/methods random(), seed(), getstate(), and setstate().  
- The seed() method initializes the random number generator.  
- The getstate() method returns an object that captures the current internal state of the generator.  
- The setstate() method passes in the parameter “state” which should be obtained from a previous call to the getstate() method. The setstate() method will restore the internal state of the generator to what it was at the time the getstate() method was called.  

## Further Readings – Dependency Injection

- Dependency injection is a technique where an object or static method supplied the dependencies of another object.  
- A dependency is an object that can be used.  
- DI is essentially a technique where one object needs a dependency but has another object create it so the first object can use it.  
- The benefits of DI include: helps with unit testing, basic code can be reduced since another object is creating it, the application becomes easier to use, and it helps make it so elements aren’t too dependent on each other.  
- The disadvantage of using DI include: it’s complex to learn and overuse, compiling errors are pushed to runtime, and IDEs can be hindered by the framework.
