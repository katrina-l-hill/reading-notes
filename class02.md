# Class 02 - HTML Text, CSS Introduction, and Basic JavaScript Instructions  

## Readings Overview  

### HTML book:  
#### Text:  
-	Using tags in a webpage allow the web browser to structure the page in a way that’s clear and logical for the user to see.
-	Structural markup are elements specific to the design of headings and paragraphs.
-	Semantic markup is used to emphasize different grammar and punctuation points in the text.
-	These usually aren’t intended to have an affect on the way the page is structured, rather on how the text is presented.
-	HTML has six (6) levels of headings (e.g., <h1> through<h6>), with h1 being the largest font size for a heading.
-	Each level of heading can have a different meaning. For example, <h1> is typically used for a main heading, while <h2>through<h6> are used for subheadings.
-	In general, paragraphs (<p> are comprised of more than one sentence. In HTML, to create a paragraph you need to have an opening and closing paragraph tags (e.g.,  <p> and </p>).
-	As such, the types of tags used to add emphasis or provide additional information include, emphasis (<em>), strong emphasis on something (<strong>), short quotes (<q>), and longer quotes (<blockquote>).
#### Introducing CSS:  
-	CSS is a language with rules set by the programmer to present a webpage in a certain way. For example, CSS language can be used to have the background of a webpage appear in a certain color, or the text appear in a certain font.
-	The programmer adds “style” to the HTML sheet using CSS rules.
-	As HTML is comprised of elements and attributes to display text in a website, CSS is comprised of selectors and declarations.
-	Selectors tell you which element the CSS rule is being applied to, while declarations tell you how the element will be styles in the webpage.
-	CSS uses external and internal rules.
-	External rules use the <link> element in an HTML to tell the webpage where to locate the CSS rule that houses the rules.
-	Internal rules use the <style> element in an HTML to apply the CSS rules to a whole webpage.
-	With CSS, it’s important to know the order in which the rules are being applied. Hence the “cascading” part of CSS.  part of CSS. You need to be strategic where you put the rules and in what order you want them to be applied.

### JavaScript book:  
#### Basic JavaScript Instructions:  
-	JavaScript is a language that uses scripts to tell the computer what to do.
-	Scripts are very detailed instructions you give to the computer when you want it to do something.
-	Scripts temporarily store data before it executes it for output. The storage area in scripts for this data is called variables.
-	Each variable must be given a name so that you can call on it to do something with the data.
-	While the word “variable” is a keyword, when paired with a name you can “call” on it to perform the action.
-	An array is a type of variable that can store more information than a typical variable. For example, arrays can store lists of items. 
#### Decisions & Loops:  
-	Decisions in code help to determine which expressions are run and what happens after they are run.
-	Decisions are made based on two components: 1. Code will check the script to see if there are any comparisons (e.g., >, <, >=, and <=) needed that would result in a true or false value. 2. If/then/else, or conditional statements, apply to the result during the code check for any comparisons.
-	If statements evaluate if a condition will be true.
-	If…else statements evaluate if a condition is true the code continues to run based on one statement, and if the condition is false, the code runs a different statement.
