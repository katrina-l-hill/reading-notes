### Learn CSS – Layout

- CSS offers many types of styling options for a webpage. You can style in the horizontal and/or vertical axis.
- In the past, webpage designs were laid out in the table elements in HTML.  
- When CSS was developed, it allowed developers to lay out webpages without having to do it in HTML.
- The display property has two functions: determine if inline or block elements are applied to the box their in, and how an element’s children should behave.
- Main layout mechanisms for multiple elements include flexbox and grid.
- Flexbox is used for one-dimensional layouts, across a single axis.
- Grid is similar to flexbox, but it is used for multi-axis layouts.
- Flow layout is used when you’re not using the flexbox or grid layouts.
- Inline-block allows you to give a block that has some characteristics of a block-level element, but still flows inline with the text.
- Floats are where an image is instructed to align in a certain direction.  
- Multicolumn layout is where you split a long list into multiple columns to help eliminate excess page scrolling and whitespace.
- Positioning changes how an element behaves in the normal flow of the document and how it relates to other elements.

#### Layout

- When you think of layout in software development, you can think of where you want the information displayed and what it looks like.
- The information you want displayed is located in “elements,” or boxes, on the website.  
- There are two types of elements in HTML: block-level and inline.
- Block-level elements are boxes that have text start on new lines. Typically, you’ll see tags like the following tags for block-level elements, h1, p, ul, and li.
- Inline elements are boxes where the text surrounds something, such as img, b, and i.
- You can use multiple stylesheets in an index.html file to import different types of layouts.
- Stylesheets can be dedicated to a single style (e.g., tables and topography).  
Positioning:
- You can position the elements by using the following positions: normal flow, relative positioning, absolute positioning, fixed positioning, and floating elements.
- Normal flow is a position where the text appears in paragraphs down the page. This is the typical way you’d see text in a webpage.
- Relative positioning is when you change the normal flow position to one where the text in a box appears indented or tabbed.
- Absolute positioning is when some boxed text is positioned on top of other text and moves as you move the webpage up and down.
- Fixed positioning is when boxed text is positioned on top of other text but does not move as you move the webpage up and down. It stays in one place.
- Floating elements is when boxed text is positioned so that other text is wrapped around it.
