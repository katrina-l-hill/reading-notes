## ES6 Overview

### ES6 Syntax and Feature Overview

- ‘’’var’’’ is a function scope that can be hoisted, reassigned, and redeclared.  
- ‘’’let’’’ is a block scope that cannot be hosted or redeclared, but can reassigned.  
- ‘’’const’’’ is a block scope that cannot be hoisted, reassigned, or redeclared.  
- ES6 introduced the ‘’’let’’’ keyword, which is a change from ES5, which used the ‘’’var’’’ keyword.  
- ES6 also introduced the ‘’’const’’’ keyword, which is not immutable.  

## React

### React – Hello World

- React is a JavaScript library.  
- The building blocks of React apps are elements and components.  

### React – JSX

- JSX is a syntax extension to JavaScript.  
- It’s typically used with React as a visual aid when working with UI inside JavaScript code.  
- JSX also allows React to show more useful error and warning messages.  
- JSX produces React “elements”.  
- “Components”contain both markup and logic.  
- You can put valid JavaScript expressions inside curly braces in JSX.  
- JSX expressions become JavsScript function calls and evaluate to JavaScript objects after it’s compiled.  
- Therefore, you can use JSX inside ‘’’if’’’ statements and ‘’’for’’’ loops, assign it to variables, accept it as arguments, and return it from functions.  

### React – Rendering Elements

- Elements are the smallest building blocks of React apps.  
- An element describes what you want to see on the screen.  
- React elements are plain objects, unlike browser DOM elements.  
- React DOM updates the DOOM to match React elements.  

### React – Components and Props

- In concept, components are like JavaScript functions.  
- They accept arbitrary inputs (“props”) and return React elements describing what should appear on the screen.  
- Components let you split the UI into independent, reusable pieces.  
- A valid React components written in JavaScript accepts a single “props” object argument with data and returns a React element.  
- These are called “function components” because they are literally JavaScript functions.  

### React – State and Lifecycle

- Use ‘’’root.render()’’’ to change rendered output.  
- “State” is similar to props, but it is private and fully controlled by the component.  
- To convert a function to a class, you need to do 5 steps: 1) create an ES6 class, with the same name that extends ‘’’React.Component”, add a single empty method to it called ‘’’render()’’’, move the body of the function into the render() method’’’, replace ‘’’props’’’ with ‘’’this.props’’’ in the ‘’’render()’’’ body, then delete the remaining empty function declaration.  
- To add lifecycle methods to a class, declare special methods on the component class to run some code when a component mounts and dismounts.  
- The ‘’’componentDidMount()’’’ method runs after the component output has rendered to the DOM.  
- 3 things to know about using state correctly, ‘’’setState()’’’: 1) do not modify state directly, 2) state updates may be asynchronous, and 3) state updates are merged.
