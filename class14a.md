# Class 14 – CSS Transforms, Transitions, and Animations

## Reading Overview 14a

### Transforms

- The transform property allows you to change the size, position, and elements in CSS3.
- It has a value that can specify the type and specific amount.
- It also has two settings, two-dimensional and three-dimensional.
- Two-dimensional (2-D) transforms work on the horizontal and vertical axes (i.e., x and y axes ), while three-dimensional (3-D) transforms work on the x-, y-, and z-axes.
- 2D transforms rotate an element from 0 to 360 degrees using a positive value to rotate an element clockwise and a negative value to rotate it counterclockwise.
- 3D transforms not only change an element on horizontally and vertically, but it also changes it in depth, length, and width.
- With 3D transforms, you can also bend an element in half but rotating about the x and y axes.
- You can also rotate elements about the z-axes.
- 3D transforms can rotate an element from 0 to 360 degrees using a positive value to rotate an element clockwise and a negative value to rotate it counterclockwise.

### Transitions & Animations

- Transitions allow you to change the appearance and behavior of an element in CSS3 when it’s state changes (e.g., hovering over or focusing on).
- There are four transition properties you can use, transition-property, transition-duration, transition-timing-function, and transition-delay.
- Different types of transitions include fade-in, change color, grow, shrink, rotate, square to circle, 3D shadow, swing, and inset border.
- Animations allow you to change the appearance and behavior of an element in CSS3 by changing it in different keyframes.
- Animations offer more control over visual effects than transitions.
