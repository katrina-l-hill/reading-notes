# Read - Mongo and Mongoose

## NoSQL vs SQL

- Non- Structured Query Language (NoSQL) databases are a nonrelational type of database that provides a way of storing and retrieving data.
- This means the data is not defined between relationships, unlike Structured Query Language (SQL) based databases.
- SQL based databases are used for applications that require a large data volume and flexible data models.
- They are flexible, scalable, and allow high performance.
- SQL is a relational type of language, used to communicate with a database by extracting and organizing data stored in a relational database. This means you can manipulate the data in the database.

1. Fill in the chart below with five differences between SQL and NoSQL databases:  
| SQL | NoSQL |  
| ---- | ---- |  
| Relational Databases (RDBMS) | Non-relational or distributed database |  
| Table-based (data is presented in tables) | Document-based, key-value pairs, graph databases or wide-column stores (do not have standard presentation) |  
| Predefined data presentation | Dynamic, not predefined for unstructured data |  
| Vertically scalable (scalable by increasing the amount of memory) | Horizontally scalable (scalable by increasing the number of database servers in the pool of resources) |  

1.What kind of data is a good fit for an SQL database? Complex query intensive environment.  
2.Give a real world example. A situation where data needs to be manipulated and the relationships between the data must be known or predefined. Also, in situations where there is heavy data traffic.  
3.What kind of data is a good fit a NoSQL database? Data that is scalable and doesn’t need to be manipulated fast.  
4.Give a real world example. A situation where large data sets are needed to be queried and available for use.  
5.Which type of database is best for hierarchical data storage? NoSQL.  
6.Which type of database is best for scalability? SQL  

### Mongoose API

- Mongoose is an Object Data Modeling (ODM) library in JavaScript used for MongoDB and Node.js.
- Mongoose creates a connection between MongoDB and Express.js framework.
- It manages the relationship between data and is used to translate between objects in code and the representation of those objects in MongoDB.

### React Router

- React Router is a library that can be used in React. It allows you to navigate between different views of the components in a React application.
- The <Router> tag uses HTML5 history API to keep you from having to refresh the browser and keep the URL up to date.

### SQL vs NoSQL Video

1. What does SQL stand for? Structured Query Language
2. What is a relational database? Works with certain assumptions and supports the SQL language.
3. What type of structure does a relational database work with? Tables
4. What is a ‘schema’? Strict requirements for the data stored in tables.
5. What is a NoSQL database? Databases, collections, and documents. No relations, they need to be merged manually. Less merging and more fast querying.
6. How does it work? All the information goes in one place and is not organized into tables, like SQL.
7. What is inside of a Mongo database? Lots and lots of data.
8. Which is more flexible - SQL or MongoDB? and why. MongoDB is more flexible because it’s easier to increase the scale of the database by horizontal scaling by way of adding more servers and splitting the database between them.
9. What is the disadvantage of a NoSQL database? It has no schema, so you can’t rely on the record to have a specific field of data.
