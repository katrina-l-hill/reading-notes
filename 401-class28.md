# Read – Django CRUD and Forms

## Django Forms

- Forms are a way to collect information from users and goes to the server.  
- They can be created to use text boxes, checkboxes, radio buttons, etc.  
- The CRUD method used for forms is POST.  
- In HTML, the developer would need to write the form from scratch, but in Django, there is a framework for defining forms and their fields.  
- HTML forms are defined as a collection of elements inside the form tags that contain at least one input of the element type=”submit”.  

### Django form handling process

- Django forms uses the view to get a request, then generates and returns an HTML page from a template.  
- The view performs any of the requested actions before generating and returning the HTML page.  
- The Django flow is as follows:  
  - The form mainly display the default form the first time a user makes a request  
  - Receives data from a submit request and binds it to the form  
  - Cleans and validates the data in the form  
  - Re-displays any invalid data in the form with the user submitted invalid data and error messages  
  - If the data is valid, the submitted request is performed.  
  - Once the actions are complete, the user is redirected to another page.  
- The **Form** class is at the heart of the form handling system in Django.  
- It performs many tasks such as displaying widgets, error messages for invalid data or fields, labels, etc.  
- A form is declared by importing the **forms** library, calling the **Forms** class, and declaring the form’s fields.  
  - form django import forms  
  - class <NameOfForm>(forms.Form):  
- There are many types of form fields including CharField, DateField, EmailField, ImageField, etc.  
- Common arguments for the form fields include required, label, widget, help_text, error_messages, etc.  
- Django provides many areas where data can be validated in a form.  
- The easiest way is to override the **clean_<fieldname>()** method in a single field.  

### URL configuration

- The URL configuration redirects URLs with a particular form to a function in the **views.py** file, and sends the instance id as the parameter named **pk**.  

### View

- The view renders the default form when it’s first called and then will either re-render the form with errors if data is invalid or process the data and redirect the user to a new page if the data is valid.  
- To do this, the view has to know if it’s being called for the first time to render the default form or if it’s being called subsequent times to validate data.  

### The template

### Testing the page

## ModelForms

- Use a **ModelForm** helper class to create a form from your model if you need your form to map the fields of as single model.  
- The ModelForm can be used within your views in the same way as an ordinary Form.  

## Generic editing views

- Django creates a “boilerplate” form handling algorithm by creating a generic editing view that allows you to create, edit, and delete views based on models.  
- These views automatically create the form class, **ModelForm**, for you from the model.
