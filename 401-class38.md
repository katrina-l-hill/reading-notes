## React – Conditional Rendering

- Conditions work the same in React as they do in JavaScript.  
- You create conditions using the “if” or the “conditional operator” to create elements that represent the current state. Then you can let React use the UI to render them.  
- In React, you can create components that contain behavior you need and render on that behavior, depending on the state of the application.  
- Variables can be used to store elements, which can help the conditional rendering of the part of the component you need.  

## React – Lists & Keys

- To transform arrays into lists in React, use the same functions as you would in JavaScript.  
- Curly braces ({ }) can be used to build collections of elements that can be included in JSX.  
- Lists are typically rendered inside a component.  
- A “key” is a special string attribute and needs to be included when creating lists of elements.  
- They help React identify which items have changed, are added, or are removed.  
- Keys should be given to the elements inside the array to give the elements a stable identity.  
- When picking a key, use a string that uniquely identifies a list item among its siblings.  
- Typically, an ID from the data is used as the key.  
- When you don’t have stable IDs for rendered items, use the item index as a key.  
- It’s not recommended to use indexes for keys if the order of items may change. This can negatively impact performance and cause issues with component state.  

## React – Forms

- In React, HTML forms keep some internal state, versus other DOM elements.  
- In React form elements versus HTML, mutable state is typically kept in the state property of components, and only updated with setState().  
- “Single source of truth” is a way to combine the React and HTML form elements by having the React component that renders a form also control what happens in that form on subsequent user input.  
- The “controlled component” is the input form element whose values is controlled by React.  
- With a controlled component, the input’s value is always driven by the React state. This means you can pass the value to other UI elements too, or reset it from other event handlers.  

## React – Lifting State

- Lift the state when you need several components to reflect the same changing data.  
- To do this, you would lift the shared state up to it’s closest common ancestor.  
- Then, you remove the local state into a parent component.  
- If the parent component owns the shared state, it becomes the “source of truth” for inputs.  
- If the props of child components are coming from the same parent component, the inputs will always be in sync.  
- Props are read-only.  
- There should be a single “source of truth” for any data that changes in a React application.  
- This creates a top-down data flow by adding the state to the component that needs it for rendering, then, if other components also need it, you can lift it up to their closest common ancestor.  
- Lifting state takes less work to find and isolate bugs because the state lives in some component and that component alone can change it. This creates less ability for bugs to be created.  

## React – Component vs Inheritance

- It’s recommended to use React’s composition model instead of inheritance to reuse code between components.  
- To let components know they’re children, use the “children” prop to represent generic “boxes” to pass the children elements directly into their output.  
- This lets other components pass arbitrary children to them by nesting the JSX.  
- Anything inside the JSX tag gets passed into the parent component as a “children” prop.  
- To achieve composition in React, use a more specific component that renders a more generic one and configures it with props.  
- Composition works equally well for components defined as classes.  
- Props and composition gives all the flexibility needed to customize a component’s look and behavior in an explicit and safe way.  
- Components may accept arbitrary props, including primitive values, React elements, or functions.
