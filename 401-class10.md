## What is Jupyter Lab

- JupyterLab allows you to use text editors, terminals, and Jupyter notebooks in a web-based user interface.  
- JupyterLab enables workflows for interactive computing such as Code Consoles (to run code interactively), Kernal-backed documents (e.g., Markdown, Python, etc.), and live previews of document editors.  
- You can also view different file formats such as JSON, Markdown, PDF, HDF5, etc.  

## Numpy Tutorial

- Numerical Python (aka NumPy) is a Python library that processes multidimensional arrays (aka matrices).  
- It also has mathematical functions for algebra, matrices, etc.  
- Numpy allows you to increase your workflow and interface with other data analysis packages in Python.  
- A limitation of Numpy is that all elements in an array have to be of the same type.  
- Like Python, NumPy is zero-indexed.  
- Data types used in NumPy include float, int, string, and object.  
- You can do single and double array math in NumPy.  
- NumPy uses several methods such as sum, mean, std, min, and max.  
- NumPy also uses comparisons operators such as <, >, >=, <=, and ==.

- Text editor can do syntax highlighting and configurable indentation.  
- Terminals provide full support for shells on Mac, Linux, and Powershell.  
- All popular image formats are supported as standalone files.  
- Delimiter separated values with commas, semicolons, and tabs are loaded fast.  
- Jupyter notebooks are a way to work with data and code seamlessly.  
- Jupyter notebooks has two modes: command and edit.  
- The command mode is the default mode when you open Jupyter notebook.  
- The command mode is designed for you to easily navigate and change the framework of the notebook.  
- The framework is composed of cells which keep the data and notes in different containers.  
- The edit mode is used to edit the current cell. You can do this by pressing enter.  
- You can use Markdown in the notebook cells as you would in a regular text editor.  
- The cell can also be changed to code for which you can also select your programming language.  
- The Kernal will show a number next to the code you typed in, which is the execution order of your code in the Kernal.  
- Changing the code in the Kernal will also change the execution order number of the code.  
- Jupyter notebooks are designed to allow you to jump around to different cells and execute code that affects the whole notebook.
