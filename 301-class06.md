# Read - NODE.JS

## An Introduction to Node.js on sitepoint.com

- Node.js is an open-source, single-threaded, event-driven back-end server program that uses JavaScript to execute code on a server so it can run in Google Chrome.
- It uses JavaScript code and converts it to native machine language. Which means that is converts JavaScript speaks the language of the machine (i.e., microprocessors).
- Google Chrome’s V8 JavaScript Engine is what Node.js uses to display webpages using JavaScript code.
- V8 is open-source and uses ES6.
- Node Package Manager (npm) is a software registry that contains code packages you can install.
- npm packages are downloaded as package.json files.
- Node.js uses a npm to it on your local computer from the registry.
- You can also install npm packages to specific project locally rather than globally.
- Node.js is used to get multiple requests to the back-end server without waiting for one request and result to be completed before the other requests begin.
- Essentially, it does not block input/output (I/O) requests.
- It also allows JavaScript to run on the back-end server.
- Advantages of using Node.js is for speed, scalability, and being able to use JSON.
- A downside to using Node.js is that it’s single-threaded, so the number of requests it can handle is limited by the size of your computer’s RAM. This is bog down your system processing speed.
- Node.js is a suitable program for data intensive, non-I/O blocking, real-time applications.

1. What is node.js? Node.js is an open-source, single-threaded, event-driven back-end server program that uses JavaScript to execute code on a server so it can run in Google Chrome.
2. In your own words, what is Chrome’s V8 JavaScript Engine? Google Chrome’s V8 JavaScript Engine is what Node.js uses to display webpages using JavaScript code.
3. What does it mean that node is a JavaScript runtime? It can execute JavaScript code.
4. What is npm? Node Package Manager (npm) is a software registry that contains code packages you can install.
5. What version of node are running on your local machine? v16.14.0
6. What version of npm are running on your local machine? 8.3.1
7. What command would you type to install a library/package called ‘jshint’? npm install -g jshint
8. What is node used for? It’s used for packaging JavaScript files and dependencies, running tests, automatic linting, and style checking.

## 6 Reasons for Pair Programming

- Pair programming is where two programmers work together on one computer to write code on a project.
- The pair take turn with one programmer being the navigator and telling the other programmer what to type (i.e., driver). Then they switch roles.
- Pair programming is a good way to practice the four language skills: listening, speaking, reading, and writing.
- Also, through pair programming, you can learn greater efficiency, engaged collaboration, learning from fellow students, social skills, job interview readiness, and work environment readiness.

1. What are the 6 reasons for pair programming? Greater efficiency, engaged collaboration, learning from fellow students, social skills, job interview readiness, and work environment readiness.
2. In your experience, which of these reasons have you found most beneficial? I found learning from fellow students to be most beneficial. In my experience, I’ve noticed that there’s more than one way to solve a coding problem. Each person brings their own experience, understanding, and style to coding. It’s nice to pick up ideas and prospective from other students.
3. How does pair programming work? Two programmers work together on one computer to write code on a project. The pair take turn with one programmer being the navigator and telling the other programmer what to type (i.e., driver). Then they switch roles. The Navigator thinks about the goals, direction the project should be going, and figures out problems The Driver is the “hands on the wheels” programmer who does the text editing, file switching, and works in the version control.
