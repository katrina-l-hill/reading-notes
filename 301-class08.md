## API Design Best Practices
1. What does REST stand for? Representational State Transfer
2. REST APIs are designed around a __resource__.
3. What is an identifer of a resource? A unique way to identify a resource using a sequence of characters. Give an example. JSON
4. What are the most common HTTP verbs? GET, POST, PUT, PATCH, and DELETE
5. What should the URIs be based on? Nouns (the resource), not verbs (the operations on the resource)
6. Give an example of a good URI. JSON
7. What does it mean to have a ‘chatty’ web API? Having a large number of web requests from the client application. Is this a good or a bad thing? It’s a bad thing because it puts a big load on the web server to process the requests.
8. What status code does a successful GET request return? 200 (OK)
9. What status code does an unsuccessful GET request return? 404 (Not Found)
10. What status code does a successful POST request return? 201 (Created)

### RESTful web API design
- Presently, application programming interfaces (APIs) are widely used in web applications for client interface.
- The web API should aim for platform independence and service evolution.
- Platform independence occurs when the client can call the API, regardless of the APIs internal implementation. To do this requires the use of standard protocols and a mechanism for the client and web service to format data exchange together.
- Service evolution occurs when the API can evolve and independently add functionality from client applications. Existing applications should continue to function without modification as the API evolves. Client applications should be able to fully use the API and functionality.

### What is REST?
- Representational State Transfer (REST) is an architectural style for a client and server to interact and distribute hypermedia. 
- It’s independent of other protocols but uses HTTP as an application protocol.
- RESTful API design principle for using HTTP include being designed around resources (e.g., object, data, or services), a Uniform Resource Identifier (URI) to uniquely identify a resource, using an exchange format for clients to interact with (e.g., JSON), using a uniform interface (e.g., standard HTTP verbs), using a stateless request model where the REST does not keep a client in state on the server, and be driven by hypermedia links contained in the representation. 

### Organize the API design around resources
- Resource URIs should focus on the resource (nouns) and not the operations of the resource (verbs).
- Avoid creating APIs that mirror the internal structure of a database.
- The purpose of REST is to model entities and the operations that an application can perform on those entities.
- Adopt a consistent URI naming convention.
- Be mindful of the number of requests (load) you put on a server. More requests can cause chattiness on web APIs.
- Avoid introducing dependencies between the web API and the underlying data sources.
- Try not to map every over every operation implemented by a web API to a specific resource.

### Define API operations in terms of HTTP methods
- The API protocol defines a few methods that assign a specific meaning to a request.
- The common HTTP methods used by mort RESTful web APIs are: GET, POST, PUT, PATCH, and DELETE.
- The effect of a specific meaning to a request should depend on whether the resource is a collection or an individual item. 
- GET retrieves information of a resource at a specified URI.
- POST creates a new resource at a specified URI.
- PUT can either create or replace a resource at a specified URI.
- PATCH does a partial update of a resource.
- DELETE removes a resource from a specified URI.

### Conform to HTTP semantics
- In HTTP, media types (aka MIME types) are the avenue by which formats  are specified. 
- For non-binary data, most web APIs support JSON (media type = application/json) and some XML (media type = application/xml).
- In the GET method, an HTTP status code 200 (OK) is returned if there is a successful GET method.
- If the resource can’t be found, a status code of 404 (Not Found) is returned.
- An HTTP status code 204 (No Content) is returned if the search has no matches.
- In the POST method, an HTTP status code 201 (Created) is returned if a new resource is created.
- An HTTP status code 400 (Bad Request) is returned if the client puts invalid data in the request.
- In the PUT method an HTTP status code 201 (Created) is returned if a new resource was created, just as the POST method. 
- If status code 200 (OK) or 204 (No Content) are returned in the PUT method, it means an existing resource was updated.
- If status code 209 (Conflict) is returned using the PUT method, it means the existing resource may not be updated.
- In the PATCH method, the status code 414 (Unsupported Media Type) is returned if the data being sent to to an existing resource isn’t in a supported format.
- If status code 400 (Bad Request) is returned using the PATCH method, it means there is a malformed patch document being sent to the existing resource.
- If status code 409 (Conflict) is returned using the PATCH method, it means the patch document being sent is valid, but the changes being sent to the existing resource can’ t be applied in its current state.
- In the DELETE method, an HTTP status code 204 (No Content) is returned if the delete operation is successful.
- If status code 404 (Not Found) is returned using the PATCH method, it means the resource doesn’t exit.
