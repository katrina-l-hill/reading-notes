## API Design Best Practices
1. What does REST stand for? Representational State Transfer
2. REST APIs are designed around a __resource__.
3. What is an identifer of a resource? A unique way to identify a resource using a sequence of characters. Give an example. JSON
4. What are the most common HTTP verbs? GET, POST, PUT, PATCH, and DELETE
5. What should the URIs be based on? Nouns (the resource), not verbs (the operations on the resource)
6. Give an example of a good URI. JSON
7. What does it mean to have a ‘chatty’ web API? Having a large number of web requests from the client application. Is this a good or a bad thing? It’s a bad thing because it puts a big load on the web server to process the requests.
8. What status code does a successful GET request return? 200 (OK)
9. What status code does an unsuccessful GET request return? 404 (Not Found)
10. What status code does a successful POST request return? 201 (Created)

### RESTful web API design
- Presently, application programming interfaces (APIs) are widely used in web applications for client interface.
- The web API should aim for platform independence and service evolution.
- Platform independence occurs when the client can call the API, regardless of the APIs internal implementation. To do this requires the use of standard protocols and a mechanism for the client and web service to format data exchange together.
- Service evolution occurs when the API can evolve and independently add functionality from client applications. Existing applications should continue to function without modification as the API evolves. Client applications should be able to fully use the API and functionality.
### What is REST?
- Representational State Transfer (REST) is an architectural style for a client and server to interact and distribute hypermedia. 
- It’s independent of other protocols but uses HTTP as an application protocol.
- RESTful API design principle for using HTTP include being designed around resources (e.g., object, data, or services), a Uniform Resource Identifier (URI) to uniquely identify a resource, using an exchange format for clients to interact with (e.g., JSON), using a uniform interface (e.g., standard HTTP verbs), using a stateless request model where the REST does not keep a client in state on the server, and be driven by hypermedia links contained in the representation. 
### Organize the API design around resources
### Define API operations in terms of HTTP methods
### Conform to HTTP semantics

#### Media Types
#### GET methods
#### POST methods
#### PUT methods
#### PATCH methods
#### DELETE methods
#### Asynchronous operations
### Filter and paginate data

#### Support partial response for large binary resources

### Use HATEOAS to enable navigation to related resources
### Versioning a RESTful web API

#### No versioning
#### URI versioning
#### Query string versioning
#### Header versioning
#### Media type versioning
### Open API Initiative
