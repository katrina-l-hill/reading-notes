## Matplotlib Tutorial

### Introduction

- Matplotlib is a Python library that can plot data and be used to create data visualizations that can be interactive, static, or animated.  
- The interface for matplotlib is Pylab and uses NumPy for mathematical equations and analysis.  
- pyplot is a module in matplotlib that is used to make changes to visualized data.  
- pyplot can be used to plot lines, decorate labels, create figures, etc.  
- Matplotlib can be used to customize plotted data such as adjusting line width, color, style, text, font, grid, and figure size.  
- It can also be used to customize the x- and y-axes such as tick marks and labels.  
- You can add a label, a legend, move the spines, annotate data points, etc.  

## Figures, Subplots, Axes, and Ticks

- In matplotlib, a figure is the window in the user interface and displays the data visually.  
- Figures can be illustrated with parameters that include the argument, default, and description.  
- Subplots plots are plots arranged in a specified number of rows and columns and number of plots.  
- Axes are similar to subplots but can be placed in any location and arrangement.  
- Ticks can be formatted to be placed a specified distance apart, by location, on a logarithmic scale, not at all, etc.  

## Animation

- Matplotlib supports various types of animations for displaying data.  
- The animations include drip drop which resembles a rain drops plopping down.  
- The drip drop effect can be illustrated by transparency, frequency, size, etc.  

## Other Types of Plots

- The different types of plots that can be incorporated using matplotlib include the regular (plot lines and/or markers), scatter (plot of x-axis versus y-axis), bar (rectangles), contour (contour lines and filled contours), imshow (displays an image to current axes), quiver (2-D field of arrows), pie chart (pie slices of an array), grid (small squares within the figure), multiplot (several plots at once), 3D (2D or 3D data), and text (text can be drawn out in the figure).

### Seaborn tutorial

- Seaborn is a Python library that uses matplotlib to visualize data.  
- It allows you to graph statistical information.  

### Bokeh tutorial

- Bokeh is another Python library that creates interactive visualizations of data.  
- It utilizes the web browser to display the data.
