## Pandas in 10

- Pandas is a Python library to analyze and manipulate data.  
- Pandas is imported in Python using **import pandas as pd**.  
- Itâ€™s used with a Series, which can pass in parameters such as data, index, a data type for the output, a name, and copied data.  
- The data is passes contains data stored in the Series. It can be in the form of an array, dictionary, be iterable, or a scalar value (one unit of data).  
- The index passed in must be hashable and of the same length as the data that was passed in.  
- The data type, or dtype, is optional and can be as a series, a NumPy data type, or an extension data type.  
- A name parameter is optional in Pandas and is the name given to the Series, and must be as a string.  
- Panda Series can also pass in a copy parameter that is a Boolean data type and defaults to being False.  

## Object creation

- Create a Series by passing in a list of values.  
- Create a DataFrame by passing in a NumPy array or a dictionary of objects.  
- Pandas DataFrames have one data type per column while NumPy arrays have one data type for the whole array.  

## Selection

- To find data in a Series, you need to select by a single column, square brackets [], use a label, by position of the passed integers, integer slicing, integer position locations, and explicitly putting in a value.  
- You can also select data by Boolean indexing to find values where the boolean condition is met.  

## Missing data

- Pandas uses the value **np.nan** to identify missing data.  
- You can drop any rows with missing data, fill in missing data, and return a Boolean value where data is missing.  

## Operations

- Pandas can run statistics operations such as finding the mean of data, histograms, and string methods.  
- String methods can be used on individual elements in an array, and does this by using regular expressions, by default.  

## Data manipulation

- Data in a Series can be manipulated by merging, grouping, or reshaping.  
- Merging data can consist of concatenation or joining.  
- Concatenating data puts chunks of data together in a Series.  
- Joining data is a way to combine two DataFrame indexes into a single DataFrame.  
- Grouping data is done by using one or all of the following steps: splitting, applying, and combining.  
- Data can be split into groups, with a function being applied to put the groups together, then combining the results of the grouped data into a data structure.  
- Reshaping data can be done using the stack() method and pivot tables (pivot_table() method) to aggregate data.  

- To get data in and out of a Series, you can write it to a .csv file or HDF5 Store, which is a dictionary-like object that reads and writes pandas.
