# Read - More CRUD

## CRUD Basics

- CRUD stands for Create, Read, Update, and Delete.
- It’s used to apply basic functions in Mongoose to interact with the database application.
- There are associated REST methods to go with the CRUD functions, these are POST, GET, PUT, and DELETE.
- The Create function corresponds to a new input/request to the API. This corresponds to the POST function.
- The Read function allows you to view the new input/request that was sent to the API in a web page. This corresponds to the GET function.
- The Update function replaces the current data of the input/request on the API with new input. This is done using “:id” after the name of the name of the input/request. Update corresponds to the PUT function.
- The Delete function allows you to delete the input/request. This corresponds to the DELETE function.
