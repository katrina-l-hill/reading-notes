# Read - Functional Programming

## Functional Programming Concepts

- Functional programming is writing clean code comprised of pure functions, without statements or variables.  
- Functional programming is only related to calculating and returning the final output.
- Pure functions are functions that have the same input and returns the same output.
- Pure functions also have no side effects such as mutating input, random number generation, console.log, HTTP calls, reading external files (changing filesystems), and querying the DOM.
- Functional programming is called a first-class function if it treats functions like other variables.
- That is, the function can store functions as variables, be passed as an argument to other functions and return them as values from other functions.

## Functional Programming Concepts Questions

1. What is functional programming? Writing clean code comprised of pure functions, without statements or variables, and only related to calculating and returning the final output.
2. What is a pure function and how do we know if something is a pure function? A pure function is simple and clean code. We know we have a pure function if it has the same input and returns the same output that was input, has no side effects such as mutating input, random number generation, console.log, HTTP calls, reading external files (changing filesystems), and querying the DOM.  
3. What are the benefits of a pure function? They are easier to test, they have no side-effects, so we don’t have to worry about the data mutating, and they result in fewer bugs in code because of the previously mentioned benefits.

## Node JS Tutorial for Beginners #6 – Modules and require()

1. What is a module? A module is another JavaScript file that has different chunks of code that have certain functionality in the application. They can be called upon when needed.
2. What does the word ‘require’ do? It’s placed on the global object so it can be used anywhere in the application. We pass in a function to ‘require’ for getting a pathway to the module we require in the file.
3. How do we bring another module into the file that we are working on? ‘./’. We take in a string and place dot backslash between the single quotations to make the path to bring in another module into the file we’re working on.
4. What do we have to do to make a module available? Inside the module we want to ‘require’, we need to add the property “module.exports” and set it equal to what we want to make available outside the module so it can be input into another module. Which would be the variable you created in the module we want to be required. Ex: module.exports = variable;. Then we need to go into the module where we want to ‘require’ the data, and set the variable we are passing into the ‘require’ module equal to what we ‘require’ from another module for what we’re trying to pass in. Ex: let variable = require(‘./__’);. Essentially, we made a reference to the variable reference in the ‘require’ module for the function we want to pass in.
