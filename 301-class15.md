## What is OAuth?
1. What is OAuth? Is a way for two unrelated sites to communicate across a virtual bridge to pass credentials about a user trying to gain access to one of the sites.
2. Give an example of what using OAuth would look like. An example would be the virtual bridge between GitHub and Netlify or GitHub and Heroku.
3. How does OAuth work? It works by two websites having an OAuth agreement to create a virtual bridge whereby a user can log onto one of those sites and be able to access the other one by selected the link for the other site. By clicking on the other link, the user’s login credentials for the site they’re currently on will be passed to the site they’re wanting to get in, thereby authenticating them onto the desired site. 
What are the steps that it takes to authenticate the user? Step 1: the user is logged into a site where they had to input their login credentials. Step 2: The user clicks on a link for their desired website. Step 3: this click brings up another page that asks the user to click on an OAuth button for their desired website. The user can choose to authorize the website their logged into to be able to send their credentials to the desired website or not. If they choose to authorize the transfer of credentials, an email is sent to the user notifying them of the authorization for reference.
4. What is OpenID? It’s an authorization vehicle for people logging into computers.

## Authorization and Authentication flows
1. What is the difference between authorization and authentication? Authorization is the process of allowing someone or something to access data after authentication has been successful. Authentication is when a user is proving ownership over their identity by providing their login credentials.
2. What is Authorization Code Flow? It the process by which an Authorization code is exchanged for a token to pass the server’s client information to call an API to access a user’s information.
3. What is Authorization Code Flow with Proof Key for Code Exchange (PKCE)? It creates a secure way for an application that’s calling to an API to access a user’s information to be verified by the authorization server. The secure way is called the Code Verifier.
4. What is Implicit Flow with Form Post? It’s an alternative way for Public Clients or applications that are trying to request an access token through the Authorization Code Flow but are not able to securely store client information. 
5. What is Client Credentials Flow? It’s a way for a machine to authorize an app versus authorizing a user.
6. What is Device Authorization Flow? If a device is input-constrained, Device Authorization Flow allows a user to authenticate a device rather than the user through a link on their device.
7. What is Resource Owner Password Flow? It requests the user to provide their login credentials in a form which is then exchanged for an access token.
