## Quiz: Binary Trees, Binary Search Trees, and K-ary Trees

1. What allows you to search for a node or print out the contents of a tree? Traversing  
2. In a _____, nodes are organized in a manner where all values that are smaller than the _____ are placed to the left, and all values that are larger than the_____ are placed to the right. BST, root, root  
3. Binary Search Trees have a Big O time complexity of O(__). O(h), or O(height)  
4. Binary Search Trees have a Big O space complexity of O(__).  O(1)  
5. True or False. In Traversals, breadth first traversal iterates through the tree by going through each matrix of the tree node-by-node. False, “level”  
6. True or False. Binary trees have a specific sorting order. False, “no”  
7. What is a tree called that has a Node with more than 2 children? K-ary Tree  
8. What are the structural rules for where nodes are “supposed to go?” There are no structural rules  
9. How do you search a BST? Compare the node you are searching for against the root of the tree or sub-tree.  
10. How many children does a leaf node have? None
