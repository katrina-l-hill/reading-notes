## Read & Write Files in Python

- Reading and writing files is the most common thing you do in Python.  
- A file is a bytes used to store data which is organized in a specific manner.  
- Files can range from text to executable.  
- For the computer to process them, files are translated into binary 1s and 0s.  

### What is a File?

- Files are mostly comprised of a Header, Data, and End of file.  
- The Header consists of metadata about the file’s contents (e.g., file name, size, and type).  
- The Data consists of what has been written by someone.  
- The End of file (EOF) consists of a special character that let’s the computer know it’s at the end of the file.  
- The type of data in the file is dictated by the file extension (e.g., .doc, .xml, .txt, etc.).  
- A path to the file on the computer is call the file path. This is the location by which you access the file.  
- The file path consists of the Folder Path, File Name, Extension.  
- The Folder Path is the location of the file and any other folders or files within it.  
- The File Name is the name of the file itself.  
- The Extension is located at the end of the File Name and is preceded by a period (“.”). It describes the type of file the document is.  

### Opening and Closing a File in Python

- Opening and closing a file in Python can be done by invoking the built-in “open” function (open()) and “close” function (close()), or you can do both with one statement, the “with” statement (e.g., with open(‘monty_python.txt’) as reader: ...  
- To open a specific file, you will need to pass in a single argument. E.g., file = open(‘monty_python.txt’).  
- To lose a file, you type file.close().  
- There are 3 different file object categories: Text, Buffered binary, and Raw binary.  
- Text files are the most common and is the default file type when used with the open function. They end in “txt.”  
- Buffered binary files are used for reading and writing binary files.  
- When opening these types of files, you need to pass in additional statements with the file and extension. E.g., r: open for reading (default), w: open for writing, truncating (overwriting) the file first, and rb or rw: open in binary mode (read/write using byte data); file = open(‘monty_python.txt, ‘r’).  
- Raw files is a low-level building block used for binary and text streams, and thus not typically used.  

### Reading and Writing Opened Files

- The methods for reading a file include “.read(size=-1),” “.readline(size=-1),” and “.readlines().”  
- Iterating over a file while reading can be done using the .readlines() function. This function can iterate over each line in a file or over each element in a file.  
- The methods for writing to a file include “.write(string)” which writes the string to the file, and “.writelines(seq)” which writes the sequence to the file.  
- Appending to a file is accomplished the “a” character to pass into the open() function. E.g., “with open(‘monty_python.txt”, ‘a’).  

## Exceptions in Python

- Exceptions occur when syntax is correct but Python has a problem executing the code.  
- Python will provide details on what the exception is so that it can be corrected and the code run again.  

### Raising an Exception

- A programmer can manually throw, or “raise”, an exception when a specific condition occurs.  
- In order to raise an exception, you use the “raise” statement followed by the Exception() function.  
- The “AssertionError” exception can be used to keep a code execution from stopping midway if an error is encountered.  
- This exception asserts that a condition is met, and if true the code will continue executing, but if the condition if false and AssertionError will be thrown at the end of the code execution, not when at the point when the assertion is false.  

### The “try” and “except” Block: Handling Exceptions

- Try and except are used to catch and handle exceptions.  
- The try statement is executed normally but when the except statement is executed it will handle any exception encountered during code execution.  
- Essentially, the exception statement tells Python what to do when an error occurs.  

### The “else” Clause

- The else statement is used to tell Python what to do if there are no exceptions found during code execution.  
- Essentially, the code will run from “try” to “else.”  

### Cleaning up after Using “finally”

- The finally statement is used at the end of the “try,” “except,”, and “else,” statements to tell Python what to do when all the code has been executed (e.g., print()).
