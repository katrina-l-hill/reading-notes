#### Forms

- A form is a document with spaces for information input. It can be printed or electronic.
- One of the most recognizable forms is the search box on the Google homepage.
- Forms can also allow you users to do other things than search for information.
- You may also encounter forms when you electronically sign up for a new doctor or dentist appointment.
- There are 4 types of form controls for collecting information: adding text (text input), making choices, submitting forms, and uploading files.
- Adding text, or text input, is typically a single line of text, for a name, address, or password.
- There are multi-line text areas you can use for having a user add comments in a comment section.
- The making choices form control can be a radio button, checkboxes, or drop-down boxes.
- This type of form control is for allowing the user to select more than one option.
- The submitting forms form control is for submitting something when they are done with adding text and/or making choices.
- This form can either be a submit button (e.g., submit information they’ve entered) or image button (e.g., a button that has words on it such as “subscribe”).
- The uploading files form allows users to upload documents or images to the website via a field where they select the location of the documents or images they want to upload.

#### Lists, Tables, and Forms

- There are several ways to create and format lists, tables, and forms in HTML.
- You can format different types of bullet points, aka markers, by using the list-style-type property.
- In addition to marker formats, you can also format image properties using the list-style-image property.
- Markers can also be positioned inside the box using the list-style-position property.
- There are many properties you can use to format a table. Width, padding, letter spacing, text alignment, hover, etc.
- You can create empty cells in a table using the empty-cells property.
- Some browsers treat empty cells differently than cells with text. They may put a border around them or hide them.

### JavaScript book

#### Events

- When you browse a webpage, the scripts in the code send update the Document Object Model (DOM) to identify any events created by the user interaction and any responses back to the user based on their input.
- There are six types of event that occur in the browser: user interface (UI), keyboard, mouse, focus, form, and mutation.
- User interface (UI) events occur when the user interacts with the browser rather than the webpage.
- Keyboard events are when the user interacts with the keyboard to enter input.
- Mouse events occur when the user interacts with the mouse, trackpad, or touchscreen.
- Focus events occur when an element gains or loses focus (e.g., a link or form field).
- Form events are when a user interact with a form element.
- Mutation events occur when the DOM structure has been changed by a script.
- Events are triggered when a user interacts with the HTML on the webpage.
- To trigger an event, you need to follow these three steps, called event handling: 1. Select the element node(s) the script will respond to, 2. Identify which of the node events will trigger the response, and 3. Identify the code you want to run when the event occurs.s
