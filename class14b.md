# Class 14 – What Google Learned About Teams

## Reading Overview 14b

### What Google Learned from its Quest to Build the Perfect Team

- The subject at the beginning of the study found that the study group she was in at college was a source of stress, which is contrary to some research that says the opposite.
- The source of her stress was related to the team’s dynamics and everyone’s desire to be the leader or take charge of the group.
- The second group the subject joined was the exact opposite of the first one.
- Personal productivity studies are becoming an important part of the work landscape. It allows employers and academics to dive into the decisions people make and why them make them.
- As well as why some people are more effective than others.
- The bulk of modern work is becoming more team-based and employee performance optimization isn’t enough to analyze and improve performance.
- A 2016 Harvard Business Review article found that company employees are spending more than three-quarters of their time communicating with each other.

#### Project Aristotle

- Google has spent millions of dollars measuring various aspects of their employees’ lives.
- Their studies included who the employees ate meals with to managerial traits.
- Google started Project Aristotle in 2012 to study Google teams and figure out why some succeeded and others failed.
- The research group Google put together for this project looked at many different aspects of the teams to identify patterns, but it was hard to identify any.
- They found that the data showed it didn’t matter who was on the teams.
- The researchers honed in on the “group norms” as a possible cause for how the groups behaved.

#### Group Norms and Psychological Safety

- Group norms are unwritten “rules” that people follow in a group setting.
- These rules can include tradition and standard behaviors that govern how we act when we’re in a group.
- People may behave a certain way when they’re by themselves, but when they join up as a group, the group’s norms take precedence.
- Group norms turned out to be the factor Google was looking for as to why some groups succeeded and others failed.
- Another aspect of the study was looking at a group’s collective intelligence.
- Within that, psychological safety (i.e., conversation turn-taking and empathy) became a key factor to identifying specific social norms that were vital to team success.
- When members felt safe, the group performed better, and vice versa.
