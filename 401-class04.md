# Read: Classes and Objects, Thinking Recursively

This assignment will be completed before it closes.

## Classes and Objects

- Objects are comprised of variables and methods that act on data stored in it.
- They are created using the _class- constructor.
- The class constructor creates an instance of an object to store the variables and methods.
- Classes are assigned to an object.
- Classes contain the variables and methods defined in the object.
- In order to access the variables in the object, you need to place a dot (“.”) after the instance of the object then type the variable name. Ex: object.variable.
- You can create many different objects under a class that have different variables.
- However, these variables are independent of the other variables and objects in the class. Each variable is local in scope to the object under which it’s created.
- To access a function within an object, you would need to place a dot (“.”) after the instance of the object then type the function name. Similar to accessing variables in the object. Ex: object.function().
- The __init__() function is a built-in function to Python and is called every time a class is being initiated to use an object.
- All classes must have an __init__() function.
- You would use the __init__() function to assign values to objects.

## Thinking Recursively in Python

- A recursive function is one where the function calls itself repeatedly until specific conditions are met to return a result.  
- The typical recursive algorithm structure is to divide work among function statements or clauses, or to solve it right out if it’s easy to execute.
- Recursive functions are comprised of a base case and a recursive case.
- In order to maintain the state of the recursive function, you need to either thread the state through each recursive call or toe keep the state in a global scope. Recursive call ex: def sum_numbers(current_number, running_sum). Global ex: current_number = 1, running_sum = 0.
- A data structure is recursive if it can be defined in terms of a smaller version of itself.
- Example data structures list, set, tree, and dictionary.
- Recursion data structures and recursive functions go hand-in-hand. Recursive function’s structure can be modeled after the definition of recursive data structure it takes as an input.

## Pytest Fixtures and Coverage

- It’s typical to write more than one test for unit tests. You would write a “test suite” to make sure that each test can check the different paths your code can go through.
- Fixtures are objects that contain data that can be shared across all the tests.
- In pytest, you define fixtures using the pytest.fixture decorator as well as with the function definition.
