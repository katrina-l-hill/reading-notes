## Dunder Methods

- Dunder methods (aka magic methods) are special techniques that are predefined methods in Python.  
- They’re used to improve and develop classes.  
- They are identified by the two underscores (“_”) before and after a method, such as __init__ and __str__.  
- Dunder methods are used to imitate the behavior of built-in methods such as len(), which gets the length of a string.  
- Since an empty class will return a TypeError is a len() method, using the __len__ dunder method in the class will allow this algorithm to execute.  
- The Python Data Model is how Python organizes it’s object structure to process data, such as with types and values of the objects.  
- The data model can be interfaced with by using dunder methods.  
- The dunder method to initialize and object is __init__.  This method allows you to construct objects in a class.  
- The dunder methods to represent strings of the object are __repr__, __and__, __str__.  
- The __repr__ method returns a string representation of an object.  
- The __str__ method is more designed for people to read the string that is returned, versus the __repr__ method which is designed for computers to read the object.  
- The dunder methods to iterate over an object are __len__, __getitem__, and __reversed__.  
- The __getitem__ method allows you to access the value of a list, dictionary, or tuple from a specific index.  
- The __reversed__ method allows you to iterate through items in a reverse order.  
- The dunder methods to compare instances are __eq__ and __lt__.  
- The dunder method to support addition in an object is __add__.  
- The dunder method to call an object is __call__.  
- The __enter__ and __exit__****__ dunder methods are used in conjunction with the _with_ statement in order to execute an instance first then exit it after the algorithm has finished and release memory to be used again. This is called the Context Manager.  

## Statistics - Probability

- Probability is determining the chance that something will happen.  
- In order to calculate probability, we need to figure out all the things that __could__ happen.
- Statistics is collecting and analyzing data to determine the probability that something will happen.
- Probability is theory, while statistics tests the theory.
