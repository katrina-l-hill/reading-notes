# Class 01 - Introductory HTML and JavaScript

## Readings Overview

### HMTL book:  
#### Introduction:  
-	Understanding HTML(HyperText Markup Language) and CSS (Cascading Style Sheets) can be beneficial and helpful to those who are interested in web design, want to improve their websites with better content, usefulness, and attractiveness, and communication with users. 
-	There are numerous ways people can access the web, such as web browsers (e.g., Google Chrome, Firefox, and Safari). Web browsers can work on many types of devices, such as desktop computers, cell phones, and tablets.
-	Websites are housed, or hosted, on webservers.
-	Webservers can be located all over the world.
#### Structure:  
-	HTML describes how web pages are structured, thus how you see it on a website.
-	In addition, to text, HTML uses tags, or elements, and attributes to create a page.
-	There are many types of tags and attributes you can use to either display information or tell the browser what to do with information.
#### Extra Markup:  
-	HTML5 is the latest version of the language to be introduced.
-	Each webpage should begin with a DOCTYPE declaration, which tells the browser the version of HTML it is using.
-	There are many ways to structure a webpage using elements and attributes. 
-	For example, an ID attribute is used to uniquely identify one element from another.
-	A class attribute allows you to identify many elements as being different from other elements on a page.
#### HTML5 Layout:  
-	It contains new types of elements that allow programmers to divide different parts of the page.
-	The new types of elements also help programmers describe the structure of the pages better.
-	Not all web browsers use HTML5, particularly older browsers. It’s important to be able to assist the older browsers with being able to read the new HTML version by adding elements in a CSS file that directs the older browser to render the new elements in HTML5.
#### Process & Design:  
-	When designing a website, you must ensure you’re designing it for the target audience, and not for yourself or your client.
-	In order to design a helpful and useful website, you must know who the target audience is.
-	Once you’ve identified the target audience, you need to figure out why people will want or need to visit your website.
-	To do that, you’ll need to determine the audience’s motivations and goals.
-	Following that, you’ll need to figure out what information the audience needs to get from your website and if they’re likely to return for more information.
-	To get you started on designing your website, it’s a good idea to start with a site map which will allow you to plan out the material for the website.
-	Once you’re developed the site map, you can create a wireframe of the website, which is an organized sketch of the things that will be on your page and where they will be located.

### JavaScript book:  
#### Introduction:  
-	JavaScript (JS) is a programming language that allows the programmer to make interactive webpages through the use of content and markup text.
-	JS can be used to add and remove elements, attributes, and text to webpages.
#### The ABC of Programming:  
-	To write JS is to write a script, which is a series of instructions for the computer to follow to produce a result.
-	Scripts can be compared to a recipe, handbooks (e.g., for new employees), or manuals (e.g., car maintenance).
-	In order to write a script, you need to know what your desired result will be. Basically, what you want to be accomplished.
-	Typically, you start with the big picture then work your way down to each aspect that makes up the big picture.
-	An important part of writing a script is to tell the computer what things (objects) and characteristics (properties), are, and in order to do that you need to speak in the computer’s language in vocabulary and syntax.
-	Web browsers use three programming language to create webpages: HTML, CSS, and JavaScript.
-	Each of these languages comprises a layer on the webpage. HTML is the content layer (gives the webpage structure), CSS is the presentation layer (enhances HTML content with style), and JavaScript is the behavior layer (tells the page how to behave with the content in HTML and CSS).
-	Typically, you’d start with the HTML layer, then add the CSS layer, and finally add the JavaScript layer.
