## Encryption, Decryption & Hacking

- Cryptography is a form of communication where information is concealed (i.e., coded) for security purposes.  
- Encryption is encoding the information and concealing it.  
- Decryption is decoding the information and revealing it.  
- Hacking is the process of decrypting the information.  
- The hacking process is frequency analysis, known plaintext, and brute force.  
- Frequency analysis is using the same characters (e.g., letters, numbers, images) more than others.  
- Known plaintext is the original unencrypted message.  
- Knowing some plaintext of the encrypted message can help you figure out how to decrypt it.  
- Brute force is when you try all types of methods to decrypt a message.  

## Caesar cipher

- The Caesar cipher is one of the one of the earliest forms of cryptography.  
- It uses known plaintext and some frequency analysis to encrypt and decrypt a message.  
- The Caesar cipher is a type of substitution cipher that can be used as a part of other types of ciphers.  
- Substitution ciphers are a method of replacing letters, numbers, images by a certain number of units or spaces. Essentially shifting the letters, numbers, images forwards or backwards by a certain number.  
- The Caesar cipher is named after Julius Caesar as he’s known to have used ciphers to send to his allies.  
- To break the Caesar cipher, you need to consider two things: someone knows or guesses the a substitution cipher has been used and they know they don’t know the shift value that was used to encode the message.  
- Someone can use frequency analysis or pattern words, known plaintext, or brute force.

- There’s no such thing as a 100% secure computer system.  
- Defense in depth is a strategy system architects use to handle bugs in a system.  
- It uses different security mechanisms to ward off attackers at each level of the system.  
- A drawback of substitution ciphers is letter frequency.  
- Permutation ciphers are where a message is laid out in a grid pattern and written from bottom to top per column.  
- Encryption ciphers were mechanized during WWII by the Nazis to encrypt their messages. It was called the “German Enigma.”  
- This type of cipher is called a substitution cipher.
