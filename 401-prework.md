# Prep: The Growth Mindset

## Upgrade Your Technical Skills with Deliberate Practice

• To be a good programmer, it’s not enough to just build software but to practice building software _deliberately_.  
• This means, getting out of your comfort zone and pushing yourself to practice coding on the things you find most difficult, as well as to do new things instead of what you’re used to.  
• In addition, to practice deliberately, you need to seek out opportunities outside of work or your day-to-day duties that challenge you and afford you the opportunity to increase your performance.  
• You need to be able to do challenges that can be repeated often and can be applied in different situations.  
• You also need to seek out feedback to your deliberate practice.  

## Carol Dweck on the Growth Mindset

• You can think of growth mindset as understanding that your abilities can be developed.  
• Fixed mindset kids run from error or things they don’t know and don’t engage with it to understand how to resolve the error or learn what they don’t know.  
• Growth mindset kids are the opposite. They engage with the error or what they don’t know and try to learn and fix the error.  
• Ideas for getting kids to understand they’re abilities are still being developed and on a path to growth mindset include, praising wisely, reward effort, use the word _yet_ instead of not yet.  
•  When educators create growth mindset classrooms that are rooted in _yet_, change can happen in the growth mindset of the students.  
• This can help create equality in education for all children.  

## Angela Lee Duckworth on Grit

• What’s needed in education is a better understanding of learning and motivation of the students.  
• In several research settings, Angela and her team found the single indicator for success of the research subjects was _grit_.  
• Grit is most important in the school system, particularly for kids at risk of dropping out.  
• The best idea for building grit in kids is through growth mindset.  

## Alain de Botton on Redefining Success

• People might be feeling anxiety about their careers because of job snobbery, which is being judged by what your career is and your position in the social hierarchy.  
• People aren’t so much looking to gain material goods as they are looking to gain the emotional rewards that come with acquiring material goods.  
• Envy is the dominant emotion in society, and it’s linked to the spirit of equality.  
• When you can’t relate to someone, you don’t envy them, but if you’re close to someone in the sense that you have similar backgrounds, age, etc., it’s easier to envy them.  
• There’s a correlation between society being split when telling us we can do anything while also telling us we have low self-esteem.  
• Another part of career anxiety is linked with meritocracy in society, which is the belief that we get where we are because that’s where we deserve to be. Whether it’s being a success or a failure.
