# Read - REST

## What Google Learned from its Quest to Build the Perfect Team

- The subject at the beginning of the study found that the study group she was in at college was a source of stress, which is contrary to some research that says the opposite.
- The source of her stress was related to the team’s dynamics and everyone’s desire to be the leader or take charge of the group.
- The second group the subject joined was the exact opposite of the first one.
- Personal productivity studies are becoming an important part of the work landscape. It allows employers and academics to dive into the decisions people make and why them make them.  
- As well as why some people are more effective than others.
- The bulk of modern work is becoming more team-based and employee performance optimization isn’t enough to analyze and improve performance.
- A 2016 Harvard Business Review article found that company employees are spending more than three-quarters of their time communicating with each other.

### Project Aristotle

- Google has spent millions of dollars measuring various aspects of their employees’ lives.
- Their studies included who the employees ate meals with to managerial traits.
- Google started Project Aristotle in 2012 to study Google teams and figure out why some succeeded and others failed.
- The research group Google put together for this project looked at many different aspects of the teams to identify patterns, but it was hard to identify any.
- They found that the data showed it didn’t matter who was on the teams.
- The researchers honed in on the “group norms” as a possible cause for how the groups behaved.

### Group Norms and Psychological Safety

- Group norms are unwritten “rules” that people follow in a group setting.
- These rules can include tradition and standard behaviors that govern how we act when we’re in a group.
- People may behave a certain way when they’re by themselves, but when they join up as a group, the group’s norms take precedence.
- Group norms turned out to be the factor Google was looking for as to why some groups succeeded and others failed.
- Another aspect of the study was looking at a group’s collective intelligence.
- Within that, psychological safety (i.e., conversation turn-taking and empathy) became a key factor to identifying specific social norms that were vital to team success.
- When members felt safe, the group performed better, and vice versa.

## How I explained REST to my brother

1. Who is Roy Fielding? He helped write the first web servers and created Representational State Transfer (REST).
2. Why don’t the techniques that we use today work well when we need to be able to talk to all of the machines in the world? Machines don’t talk in the same language, so each machine can’t talk to any other one if it doesn’t speak in the same language as the other machine(s).
3. What is the HTTP protocol that Fielding and his friends created? Apache HTTP Server
4. What does a GET do? It’s used to request information from another source.
5. What does a POST do? It sends data to a server.
6. What does PUT do? It creates or replaces something in another source.
7. What does PATCH do? It does a partial update of something in another source.
