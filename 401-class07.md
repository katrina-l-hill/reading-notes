## Python Scope

- Scope is how variables and name are found in your code.  
- Scope is also a way to determine where the variables and names are located and what parts of your code can use them.  

### Understanding Scope

- There are generally two types of scope, global and local.  
- The Local, Enclosing, Global, and Built-in (LEGB) rule summarizes the way variables and name are presented in code as well as the sequence Python uses to read through code.  
- Global scope is a variable and/or name that is code that’s available for use by all functions.  
- Local scope is a variable and/or name that is code that is only available to functions to which it is defined.  
- Scope can be thought of as a connection to an object. They are implemented as dictionaries.  
- The dictionaries are called namespaces.  
- Python uses namespaces to store names.  

### Using the LEGB Rule for Python Scope

- The local (function) scope is code block or body of a function (or lambda expression).  
- The enclosing (nonlocal) scope only exists in nested functions. Code inside the enclosing scope is only usable by the inner code and enclosing functions.  
- The global (module) scope is the top level scope a program, script, or module.  
- The built-in scope is created or loaded whenever you run a script or open and interactive session.  
- The local scope, or function scope, is created at function calls. Every time you call a function, you’re also creating a new local scope.  
- The enclosing, or local scope, is observed when you nest functions inside other functions. It’s a local scope of an enclosing function’s local scope.  
- The global scope is the entire program. The main script for the program is put into a module __main__ that will hold the main program’s execution.  
- You can’t access global variables or name from inside functions unless you declare the names variables or names as global names by using a “global statement.”  
- Of of two thing happen when you assign a value to a name in Python: you create a new name or you update and existing name.  
- Global names can be updated or modified from anywhere in your global Python scope.  
- However, this can lead to problems in your code such as difficulty debugging, being hard to understand, and not reusable.  
- The built-in scope is implemented as a standard library module called “builtins.”  
- They are loaded to the built-in scope when the Python interpreter is run.  
- Python searches builtins last in its LEGB lookup, which means you can use them without importing any modules.  

## Modifying the Behavior of a Python Scope

- There are two keywords used to modify the standard behavior of where scopes can be accessed. They are “global” and “nonlocal.”  
- Using the “global” keyword, you can make a statement that will allow you to define a list of names within a function that will be treated as global.  
- Using the “global” keyword in a statement within a function or nested function maps the names you provide in the global scope of Python.  
- Using the “nonlocal” keyword, you can also make a statement that will allow you to define a list of names within a function that modifies a variable inside an enclosing or nonlocal scope.  
- The nonlocal statement cannot be used in either the global scope or the local scope.
