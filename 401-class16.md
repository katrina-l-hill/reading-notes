## What is Serverless Computing?

- The term “serverless” refers to the automation and execution of different types of computing processes such as running code on demand or upon an event and scaling resources based on usage, or when an application stops.  
- It primarily relates to a customers experience with the servers that are running their applications.  
- Serverless computing is having a cloud provider take on the management for your backend infrastructure and operations.  
- Advantages of using serverless computing include reducing developer’s time spent on backend tasks so they can focus on front-end applications, and not having clients pay for idle time when they’re applications aren’t running.  
- There are many companies providing serverless computing services: Amazon Web Services (AWS Lambda), Microsoft Azure (Azure Functions), Google Cloud (Google Cloud Functions), and IBM Cloud(IBM Cloud Code Engine).  
- Serverless computing sometimes gets combined with Function as a service (FaaS), but FaaS is a subset of serverless computing that allows developers to run applications and execute in response to events.  

## Pros of serverless computing

- Developers can focus on coding instead of backend infrastructure  
- Customers don’t pay for idle time their applications aren’t running  
- Developers can code in any programming language  
- It makes deployment easier  
- Fast and cost-effective for parallel processing  
- Aggregate system and user times  

## Cons of serverless computing

- Not good for steady or long-running workload demands  
- Need to perform cold startups to process new requests if there was a scale-down to zero  
- Not easy to monitor or debug  
- Need to separate workload from virtual machine or Docker which might make it difficult to mitigate  

## Videos - What is Serverless?

- The developer is not responsible for managing and providing the server functionality. This is outsourced to the cloud.
- Business models: as they increase in business logic focus, they focus less on managing servers and more on coding.
- FaaS is a computing platform for serverless.
