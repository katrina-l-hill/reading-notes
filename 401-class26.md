## Getting Started with Django – Intro to Django

### Object-relational mapper

- With Django, you can define data models entirely in Python.  
- Models are the source of information about the SQL database Django uses.  
- It contains the information for the fields and behaviors of the data that’s stored.  
- In general, each model maps to a single database table.  
- Each model is a Python class that subclasses **django.db.models.Model**.  
- Each attribute of the model represents a database field.  
- Fields are the most important part of a model.  
- They are the only required part of a model, and are specified by a class attribute.  
- Each field in the model is an instance of the appropriate **Field** class.  
- Field class types are determined by the column type, default HTML widget, and minimal validation requirements.  
- Each field takes a certain set of field-specific arguments such as:  
  - **CharField** which requires a max_length argument  
  - **null** which requires a **True** or **False** argument  
  - **blank** which also requires a **True** or **False** argument  
  - **choices** which takes a sequence of 2-tuples.  
  - **default** which defines the default value for the field.  
  - **help_text** which displays help text in the form widget.  
  - **primary_key** which is the primary key for the model.  
  - **unique**, which must be a unique field throughout the table.  
- There are three types of relationships on Django that define database relationships: many-to-one, many-to-many, and one-to-one.  
- Many-to-one relationships use a **Field** type to include it as a class attribute in the model. It uses the **django.db.models.ForeignKey**.  
- **ForeignKey** requiures a positional argument, which is the class the model is related to.  
- Many-to-many relationships also use a **Field** type to include it as a class attribute in the model and uses the **ManytoManyField** which requires a positional argument.  
- One-to-one relationships also use a **Field** type to include it as a class attribute in the model and uses the **OnetoOneField** which requires a positional argument.  
- There are three styles of model inheritance in Django: abstract base classes, multi-table inheritance, and proxy models.  
- Abstract base classes are used when you want to put some common information into a number of other models.  
- Multi-table inheritance is used when each model in the hierarchy is a model by itself.  
- Proxy models are used for creating a proxy for the original model. Essentially, when you only want to change the Python behavior of a model, to change the default behavior, or to add a new method.  

### URLs and views

- URLs are designed by creating a Python module called a **URLconf** (URL configuration).  
- The model is made from pure Python code and is a mapping between URL path expressions to Python functions (views).  

### Templates

- Django templates are designed for comfort and ease for working with HTML.  
- It’s flexible and highly extensible, which allows developers to augment the template language, as needed.  

### Forms

- Django has a forms library for rendering forms as HTML, validating user-submitted data, and converting data to native Python types.  
- There are also ways to generate forms from existing models and use the forms to create and update data.
