# Read – Django REST Framework & Docker

## Beginner’s Guide to Docker

- Docker is a platform that allows you to isolate and run applications without having to use virtual environments.  
- Docker also allows you to share the application with others.  
- Docker can be used across different computer systems (i.e., Mac, Windows, or Linux).  
- Although Docker allows you to easily run the entire development environment in an isolated way and share with others, it is a complex platform to work with.  
- In essence, Docker is **Linux containers** which means that it’s a bunch of virtual machines running on one computer.  
- This allows developers to run different applications in containers (i.e., packages) at the same time.  
- By using the containers, you can save money on infrastructure by not having your own server and renting space from a cloud host. The cloud host will most likely run your applications in a container alongside many other companies’ applications.  
- Virtual machines also have a downside in that there are restrictions on the size and speed of your applications being run.  

### Linux Containers

- Docker solves that problem with containerization of the operating system.  
- Containerization provides all the resources of the operating system within the container for the application to work.  
- An analogy of Docker would be like an office building where different companies have their own office space but use the same resources located in the building (e.g., restrooms, electricity, cafeteria, etc.).  

### Containers vs Virtual Environments

- To Python programmers, containers and virtual environments are different.  
- Virtual environments isolate Python software packages locally so that you can run different projects that use a Python version in one environment and a Django framework version in another one on the same computer.  
- However, virtual environments can only isolate Python packages, which doesn’t make them versatile.  
- This means that they still rely on the global, system-level installation of Python, so that if you’re using a specific version of python on the system that will be the same version used in the virtual environment.  
- Another different between containers and virtual environments is that you can’t run a production database or other services within virtual environments, which makes them a limited option when compared to Docker.  

### Images and Containers

- Images and containers are fundamental concepts of Docker.  
- Images are snapshots in time of what a project contains.  
- A container is a running instance of the image.  
- There are official Docker images you can run, but you can also create your own custom image by using **Dockerfile**.  
- A **Dockerfile** can be thought of as instructions for the application you want to create.  
- An image is a snapshot of the instructions at a given time.  
- The container is the actual application you’ve created.  

## Django for APIs – Library Website

- There are two things needed to build-out a project in Django: Django and Django REST Framework.  
- The Django REST Framework is needed to help build a web API and must be added to a project **after** Django has been installed and configured.  
- There are similarities and differences between traditional Django and Django REST Framework, but the main thing to know is that Django creates websites containing webpages, while Django REST Framework creates web APIs.  
- The web APIs are a collection of URL endpoints containing available HTTP verbs (e.g., POST, GET, PUT, PATCH, and DELETE) that return JSON.
